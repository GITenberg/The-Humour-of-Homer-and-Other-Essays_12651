<h1>The Humour of Homer and Other Essays</h1>
<h2>Introduction<br />
By R. A. Streatfeild</h2>
<p>The nucleus of this book is the collection of essays by Samuel Butler,
which was originally published by Mr. Grant Richards in 1904 under the
title Essays on Life, Art and Science, and reissued by Mr. Fifield in
1908.&nbsp; To these are now added another essay, entitled &ldquo;The
Humour of Homer,&rdquo; a biographical sketch of the author kindly contributed
by Mr. Henry Festing Jones, which will add materially to the value of
the edition, and a portrait in photogravure from a photograph taken
in 1889&mdash;the period of the essays.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Humour of Homer&rdquo; was originally delivered as a lecture
at the Working Men&rsquo;s College in Great Ormond Street on the 30th
January, 1892, the day on which Butler first promulgated his theory
of the Trapanese origin of the <i>Odyssey</i> in a letter to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.&nbsp;
Later in the same year it was published with some additional matter
by Messrs. Metcalfe and Co. of Cambridge.&nbsp; For the next five years
Butler was engaged upon researches into the origin and authorship of
the <i>Odyssey</i>, the results of which are embodied in his book <i>The
Authoress of the</i> &ldquo;<i>Odyssey</i>,&rdquo; originally published
by Messrs. Longman in 1897.&nbsp; Butler incorporated a good deal of
&ldquo;The Humour of Homer&rdquo; into <i>The Authoress of the</i> &ldquo;<i>Odyssey</i>,&rdquo;
but the section relating to the <i>Iliad</i> naturally found no place
in the later work.&nbsp; For the sake of this alone &ldquo;The Humour
of Homer&rdquo; deserves to be better known.&nbsp; Written as it was
for an artisan audience and professing to deal only with one side of
Homer&rsquo;s genius, &ldquo;The Humour of Homer&rdquo; must not, of
course, be taken as an exhaustive statement of Butler&rsquo;s views
upon Homeric questions.&nbsp; It touches but lightly on important points,
particularly regarding the origin and authorship of the <i>Odyssey</i>,
which are treated at much greater length in <i>The Authoress of the</i>
&ldquo;<i>Odyssey</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, &ldquo;The Humour of Homer&rdquo; appears to me to
have a special value as a kind of general introduction to Butler&rsquo;s
more detailed study of the <i>Odyssey</i>.&nbsp; His attitude towards
the Homeric poems is here expressed with extraordinary freshness and
force.&nbsp; What that attitude was is best explained by his own words:
&ldquo;If a person would understand either the <i>Odyssey</i> or any
other ancient work, he must never look at the dead without seeing the
living in them, nor at the living without thinking of the dead.&nbsp;
We are too fond of seeing the ancients as one thing and the moderns
as another.&rdquo;&nbsp; Butler did not undervalue the philological
and arch&aelig;ological importance of the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>,
but it was mainly as human documents that they appealed to him.&nbsp;
This, I am inclined to suspect, was the root of the objection of academic
critics to him and his theories.&nbsp; They did not so much resent the
suggestion that the author of the <i>Odyssey</i> was a woman; they could
not endure that he should be treated as a human being.</p>
<p>Of the remaining essays two were originally delivered as lectures;
the others appeared first in <i>The Universal Review</i> in 1888, 1889
and 1890.&nbsp; I should perhaps explain why two other essays which
also appeared in <i>The Universal Review</i> are not included in this
collection.&nbsp; The first of these, entitled &ldquo;L&rsquo;Affaire
Holbein-Rippel,&rdquo; relates to a drawing of Holbein&rsquo;s &ldquo;Danse
des Paysans&rdquo; in the Basle Museum, which is usually described as
a copy, but which Butler believed to be the work of Holbein himself.&nbsp;
This essay requires to be illustrated in so elaborate a manner that
it was impossible to include it in a book of this size.&nbsp; The second
essay, which is a sketch of the career of the sculptor Tabachetti, was
published as the first section of an article, entitled &ldquo;A Sculptor
and a Shrine,&rdquo; of which the second part is here given under the
title &ldquo;The Sanctuary of Montrigone.&rdquo;&nbsp; The section devoted
to the sculptor contains all that Butler then knew about Tabachetti,
but since it was written various documents have come to light, principally
through the investigations of Cavaliere Francesco Negri, of Casale Monferrato,
which negative some of Butler&rsquo;s conclusions.&nbsp; Had Butler
lived, I do not doubt that he would have revised his essay in the light
of Cavaliere Negri&rsquo;s discoveries, the value of which he fully
recognized.&nbsp; As it stands the essay requires so much revision that
I have decided to omit it altogether and to postpone giving English
readers a full account of Tabachetti&rsquo;s career until a second edition
of Butler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ex Voto,&rdquo; in which Tabachetti&rsquo;s
work is discussed in detail, is required.&nbsp; Meanwhile I have given
a brief summary of the main facts of Tabachetti&rsquo;s life in a note
(p. 195) to the essay on &ldquo;Art in the Valley of Saas.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Anyone who desires further details concerning the sculptor and his work
will find them in Cavaliere Negri&rsquo;s pamphlet &ldquo;Il Santuario
di Crea&rdquo; (Alessandria, 1902).</p>
<p>The three essays grouped together under the title <i>The Deadlock
in Darwinism</i> may be regarded as a postscript to Butler&rsquo;s four
books on evolution, viz. <i>Life and Habit</i>, <i>Evolution Old and
New</i>, <i>Unconscious Memory</i>, and <i>Luck or Cunning</i>?&nbsp;
When these essays were first published in book form in 1904, I ventured
to give a brief summary of Butler&rsquo;s position with regard to the
main problem of evolution.&nbsp; I need now only refer readers to Mr.
Festing Jones&rsquo;s biographical sketch and, for fuller details, to
the masterly introduction contributed by Professor Marcus Hartog to
the new edition of <i>Unconscious Memory</i> (A. C. Fifield, 1910),
and recently reprinted in his <i>Problems of Life and Reproduction</i>
(John Murray, 1913), in which Butler&rsquo;s work in the field of biology
and his share in the various controversies connected with the study
of evolution are discussed with the authority of a specialist.</p>

<h3>Sketch of the Life of Samuel Butler<br />
Author of Erewhon (1835-1902)</h3>
<p>Samuel Butler was born on the 4th December, 1835, at the Rectory,
Langar, near Bingham, in Nottinghamshire.&nbsp; His father was the Rev.
Thomas Butler, then Rector of Langar, afterwards one of the canons of
Lincoln Cathedral, and his mother was Fanny Worsley, daughter of John
Philip Worsley of Arno&rsquo;s Vale, Bristol, sugar-refiner.&nbsp; His
grandfather was Dr. Samuel Butler, the famous headmaster of Shrewsbury
School, afterwards Bishop of Lichfield.&nbsp; The Butlers are not related
either to the author of <i>Hudibras</i>, or to the author of the <i>Analogy</i>,
or to the present Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>
<p>Butler&rsquo;s father, after being at school at Shrewsbury under
Dr. Butler, went up to St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge; he took
his degree in 1829, being seventh classic and twentieth senior optime;
he was ordained and returned to Shrewsbury, where he was for some time
assistant master at the school under Dr. Butler.&nbsp; He married in
1832 and left Shrewsbury for Langar.&nbsp; He was a learned botanist,
and made a collection of dried plants which he gave to the Town Museum
of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>Butler&rsquo;s childhood and early life were spent at Langar among
the surroundings of an English country rectory, and his education was
begun by his father.&nbsp; In 1843, when he was only eight years old,
the first great event in his life occurred; the family, consisting of
his father and mother, his two sisters, his brother and himself, went
to Italy.&nbsp; The South-Eastern Railway stopped at Ashford, whence
they travelled to Dover in their own carriage; the carriage was put
on board the steamboat, they crossed the Channel, and proceeded to Cologne,
up the Rhine to Basle and on through Switzerland into Italy, through
Parma, where Napoleon&rsquo;s widow was still reigning, Modena, Bologna,
Florence, and so to Rome.&nbsp; They had to drive where there was no
railway, and there was then none in all Italy except between Naples
and Castellamare.&nbsp; They seemed to pass a fresh custom-house every
day, but, by tipping the searchers, generally got through without inconvenience.&nbsp;
The bread was sour and the Italian butter rank and cheesy&mdash;often
uneatable.&nbsp; Beggars ran after the carriage all day long and when
they got nothing jeered at the travellers and called them heretics.&nbsp;
They spent half the winter in Rome, and the children were taken up to
the top of St. Peter&rsquo;s as a treat to celebrate their father&rsquo;s
birthday.&nbsp; In the Sistine Chapel they saw the cardinals kiss the
toe of Pope Gregory XVI, and in the Corso, in broad daylight, they saw
a monk come rolling down a staircase like a sack of potatoes, bundled
into the street by a man and his wife.&nbsp; The second half of the
winter was spent in Naples.&nbsp; This early introduction to the land
which he always thought of and often referred to as his second country
made an ineffaceable impression upon him.</p>
<p>In January, 1846, he went to school at Allesley, near Coventry, under
the Rev. E. Gibson.&nbsp; He seldom referred to his life there, though
sometimes he would say something that showed he had not forgotten all
about it.&nbsp; For instance, in 1900 Mr. Sydney C. Cockerell, now the
Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, showed him a medieval
missal, laboriously illuminated.&nbsp; He found that it fatigued him
to look at it, and said that such books ought never to be made.&nbsp;
Cockerell replied that such books relieved the tedium of divine service,
on which Butler made a note ending thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>Give me rather a robin or a peripatetic cat like the
one whose loss the parishioners of St. Clement Danes are still deploring.&nbsp;
When I was at school at Allesley the boy who knelt opposite me at morning
prayers, with his face not more than a yard away from mine, used to
blow pretty little bubbles with his saliva which he would send sailing
off the tip of his tongue like miniature soap bubbles; they very soon
broke, but they had a career of a foot or two.&nbsp; I never saw anyone
else able to get saliva bubbles right away from him and, though I have
endeavoured for some fifty years and more to acquire the art, I never
yet could start the bubble off my tongue without its bursting.&nbsp;
Now things like this really do relieve the tedium of church, but no
missal that I have ever seen will do anything except increase it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1848 he left Allesley and went to Shrewsbury under the Rev. B.
H. Kennedy.&nbsp; Many of the recollections of his school life at Shrewsbury
are reproduced for the school life of Ernest Pontifex at Roughborough
in <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>, Dr. Skinner being Dr. Kennedy.</p>
<p>During these years he first heard the music of Handel; it went straight
to his heart and satisfied a longing which the music of other composers
had only awakened and intensified.&nbsp; He became as one of the listening
brethren who stood around &ldquo;when Jubal struck the chorded shell&rdquo;
in the <i>Song for Saint Cecilia&rsquo;s Day</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Less than a god, they thought, there could not dwell<br />
Within the hollow of that shell<br />
That spoke so sweetly and so well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the second great event in his life, and henceforward Italy
and Handel were always present at the bottom of his mind as a kind of
double pedal to every thought, word, and deed.&nbsp; Almost the last
thing he ever asked me to do for him, within a few days of his death,
was to bring <i>Solomon</i> that he might refresh his memory as to the
harmonies of &ldquo;With thee th&rsquo; unsheltered moor I&rsquo;d trace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He often tried to like the music of Bach and Beethoven, but found himself
compelled to give them up&mdash;they bored him too much.&nbsp; Nor was
he more successful with the other great composers; Haydn, for instance,
was a sort of Horace, an agreeable, facile man of the world, while Mozart,
who must have loved Handel, for he wrote additional accompaniments to
the <i>Messiah</i>, failed to move him.&nbsp; It was not that he disputed
the greatness of these composers, but he was out of sympathy with them,
and never could forgive the last two for having led music astray from
the Handel tradition and paved the road from Bach to Beethoven.&nbsp;
Everything connected with Handel interested him.&nbsp; He remembered
old Mr. Brooke, Rector of Gamston, North Notts, who had been present
at the Handel Commemoration in 1784, and his great-aunt, Miss Susannah
Apthorp, of Cambridge, had known a lady who had sat upon Handel&rsquo;s
knee.&nbsp; He often regretted that these were his only links with &ldquo;the
greatest of all composers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides his love for Handel he had a strong liking for drawing, and,
during the winter of 1853-4, his family again took him to Italy, where,
being now eighteen, he looked on the works of the old masters with intelligence.</p>
<p>In October, 1854, he went into residence at St. John&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge.&nbsp; He showed no aptitude for any particular branch of
academic study, nevertheless he impressed his friends as being likely
to make his mark.&nbsp; Just as he used reminiscences of his own schooldays
at Shrewsbury for Ernest&rsquo;s life at Roughborough, so he used reminiscences
of his own Cambridge days for those of Ernest.&nbsp; When the Simeonites,
in <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>, &ldquo;distributed tracts, dropping
them at night in good men&rsquo;s letter boxes while they slept, their
tracts got burnt or met with even worse contumely.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ernest
Pontifex went so far as to parody one of these tracts and to get a copy
of the parody &ldquo;dropped into each of the Simeonites&rsquo; boxes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ernest did this in the novel because Butler had done it in real life.&nbsp;
Mr. A. T. Bartholomew, of the University Library, has found, among the
Cambridge papers of the late J. Willis Clark&rsquo;s collection, three
printed pieces belonging to the year 1855 bearing on the subject.&nbsp;
He speaks of them in an article headed &ldquo;Samuel Butler and the
Simeonites,&rdquo; and signed A. T. B. in the <i>Cambridge Magazine</i>,
1st March, 1913; the first is &ldquo;a genuine Simeonite tract; the
other two are parodies.&nbsp; All three are anonymous.&nbsp; At the
top of the second parody is written &lsquo;By S. Butler, March 31.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
The article gives extracts from the genuine tract and the whole of Butler&rsquo;s
parody.</p>
<p>Besides parodying Simeonite tracts, Butler wrote various other papers
during his undergraduate days, some of which, preserved by one of his
contemporaries, who remained a lifelong friend, the Rev. Canon Joseph
M&rsquo;Cormick, now Rector of St. James&rsquo;s, Piccadilly, are reproduced
in <i>The Note-Books of Samuel Butler</i> (1912).</p>
<p>He also steered the Lady Margaret first boat, and Canon M&rsquo;Cormick
told me of a mishap that occurred on the last night of the races in
1857.&nbsp; Lady Margaret had been head of the river since 1854, Canon
M&rsquo;Cormick was rowing 5, Philip Pennant Pearson (afterwards P.
Pennant) was 7, Canon Kynaston, of Durham (whose name formerly was Snow),
was stroke, and Butler was cox.&nbsp; When the cox let go of the bung
at starting, the rope caught in his rudder lines, and Lady Margaret
was nearly bumped by Second Trinity.&nbsp; They escaped, however, and
their pursuers were so much exhausted by their efforts to catch them
that they were themselves bumped by First Trinity at the next corner.&nbsp;
Butler wrote home about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>11 March, 1857.&nbsp; Dear Mamma: My foreboding about
steering was on the last day nearly verified by an accident which was
more deplorable than culpable the effects of which would have been ruinous
had not the presence of mind of No. 7 in the boat rescued us from the
very jaws of defeat.&nbsp; The scene is one which never can fade from
my remembrance and will be connected always with the gentlemanly conduct
of the crew in neither using opprobrious language nor gesture towards
your unfortunate son but treating him with the most graceful forbearance;
for in most cases when an accident happens which in itself is but slight,
but is visited with serious consequences, most people get carried away
with the impression created by the last so as to entirely forget the
accidental nature of the cause and if we had been quite bumped I should
have been ruined, as it is I get praise for coolness and good steering
as much as and more than blame for my accident and the crew are so delighted
at having rowed a race such as never was seen before that they are satisfied
completely.&nbsp; All the spectators saw the race and were delighted;
another inch and I should never have held up my head again.&nbsp; One
thing is safe, it will never happen again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Eagle</i>, &ldquo;a magazine supported by members of St. John&rsquo;s
College,&rdquo; issued its first number in the Lent term of 1858; it
contains an article by Butler &ldquo;On English Composition and Other
Matters,&rdquo; signed &ldquo;Cellarius&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most readers will have anticipated me in admitting that
a man should be clear of his meaning before he endeavours to give it
any kind of utterance, and that, having made up his mind what to say,
the less thought he takes how to say it, more than briefly, pointedly
and plainly, the better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this it appears that, when only just over twenty-two, Butler
had already discovered and adopted those principles of writing from
which he never departed.</p>
<p>In the fifth number of the <i>Eagle</i> is an article, &ldquo;Our
Tour,&rdquo; also signed &ldquo;Cellarius&rdquo;; it is an account of
a tour made in June, 1857, with a friend whose name he Italianized into
Giuseppe Verdi, through France into North Italy, and was written, so
he says, to show how they got so much into three weeks and spent only
&pound;25; they did not, however, spend quite so much, for the article
goes on, after bringing them back to England, &ldquo;Next day came safely
home to dear old St. John&rsquo;s, cash in hand 7d.&rdquo; <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19">{19}</a></p>
<p>Butler worked hard with Shilleto, an old pupil of his grandfather,
and was bracketed 12th in the Classical Tripos of 1858.&nbsp; Canon
M&rsquo;Cormick told me that he would no doubt have been higher but
for the fact that he at first intended to go out in mathematics; it
was only during the last year of his time that he returned to the classics,
and his being so high as he was spoke well for the classical education
of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>It had always been an understood thing that he was to follow in the
footsteps of his father and grandfather and become a clergyman; accordingly,
after taking his degree, he went to London and began to prepare for
ordination, living and working among the poor as lay assistant under
the Rev. Philip Perring, Curate of St. James&rsquo;s, Piccadilly, an
old pupil of Dr. Butler at Shrewsbury. <a name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20">{20}</a>&nbsp;
Placed among such surroundings, he felt bound to think out for himself
many theological questions which at this time were first presented to
him, and, the conclusion being forced upon him that he could not believe
in the efficacy of infant baptism, he declined to be ordained.</p>
<p>It was now his desire to become an artist; this, however, did not
meet with the approval of his family, and he returned to Cambridge to
try for pupils and, if possible, to get a fellowship.&nbsp; He liked
being at Cambridge, but there were few pupils and, as there seemed to
be little chance of a fellowship, his father wished him to come down
and adopt some profession.&nbsp; A long correspondence took place in
the course of which many alternatives were considered.&nbsp; There are
letters about his becoming a farmer in England, a tutor, a hom&oelig;opathic
doctor, an artist, or a publisher, and the possibilities of the army,
the bar, and diplomacy.&nbsp; Finally it was decided that he should
emigrate to New Zealand.&nbsp; His passage was paid, and he was to sail
in the <i>Burmah</i>, but a cousin of his received information about
this vessel which caused him, much against his will, to get back his
passage money and take a berth in the <i>Roman Emperor</i>, which sailed
from Gravesend on one of the last days of September, 1859.&nbsp; On
that night, for the first time in his life, he did not say his prayers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I suppose the sense of change was so great that it shook them
quietly off.&nbsp; I was not then a sceptic; I had got as far as disbelief
in infant baptism, but no further.&nbsp; I felt no compunction of conscience,
however, about leaving off my morning and evening prayers&mdash;simply
I could no longer say them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Roman Emperor</i>, after a voyage every incident of which
interested him deeply, arrived outside Port Lyttelton.&nbsp; The captain
shouted to the pilot who came to take them in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the <i>Robert Small</i> arrived?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the pilot, &ldquo;nor yet the <i>Burmah</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Butler, writing home to his people, adds the comment: &ldquo;You
may imagine what I felt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Burmah</i> was never heard of again.</p>
<p>He spent some time looking round, considering what to do and how
to employ the money with which his father was ready to supply him, and
determined upon sheep-farming.&nbsp; He made several excursions looking
for country, and ultimately took up a run which is still called Mesopotamia,
the name he gave it because it is situated among the head-waters of
the Rangitata.</p>
<p>It was necessary to have a horse, and he bought one for &pound;55,
which was not considered dear.&nbsp; He wrote home that the horse&rsquo;s
name was &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo;: &ldquo;I hope he is a Hom&oelig;opathist.&rdquo;&nbsp;
From this, and from the fact that he had already contemplated becoming
a hom&oelig;opathic doctor himself, I conclude that he had made the
acquaintance of Dr. Robert Ellis Dudgeon, the eminent hom&oelig;opathist,
while he was doing parish work in London.&nbsp; After his return to
England Dr. Dudgeon was his medical adviser, and remained one of his
most intimate friends until the end of his life.&nbsp; Doctor, the horse,
is introduced into <i>Erewhon Revisited</i>; the shepherd in Chapter
XXVI tells John Higgs that Doctor &ldquo;would pick fords better than
that gentleman could, I know, and if the gentleman fell off him he would
just stay stock still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Butler carried on his run for about four and a half years, and the
open-air life agreed with him; he ascribed to this the good health he
afterwards enjoyed.&nbsp; The following, taken from a notebook he kept
in the colony and destroyed, gives a glimpse of one side of his life
there; he preserved the note because it recalled New Zealand so vividly.</p>
<blockquote><p>April, 1861.&nbsp; It is Sunday.&nbsp; We rose later
than usual.&nbsp; There are five of us sleeping in the hut.&nbsp; I
sleep in a bunk on one side of the fire; Mr. Haast, <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22">{22}</a>
a German who is making a geological survey of the province, sleeps upon
the opposite one; my bullock-driver and hut-keeper have two bunks at
the far end of the hut, along the wall, while my shepherd lies in the
loft among the tea and sugar and flour.&nbsp; It was a fine morning,
and we turned out about seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The usual mutton and bread for breakfast with a pudding made of flour
and water baked in the camp oven after a joint of meat&mdash;Yorkshire
pudding, but without eggs.&nbsp; While we were at breakfast a robin
perched on the table and sat there a good while pecking at the sugar.&nbsp;
We went on breakfasting with little heed to the robin, and the robin
went on pecking with little heed to us.&nbsp; After breakfast Pey, my
bullock-driver, went to fetch the horses up from a spot about two miles
down the river, where they often run; we wanted to go pig-hunting.</p>
<p>I go into the garden and gather a few peascods for seed till the
horses should come up.&nbsp; Then Cook, the shepherd, says that a fire
has sprung up on the other side of the river.&nbsp; Who could have lit
it?&nbsp; Probably someone who had intended coming to my place on the
preceding evening and has missed his way, for there is no track of any
sort between here and Phillips&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In a quarter of an hour
he lit another fire lower down, and by that time, the horses having
come up, Haast and myself&mdash;remembering how Dr. Sinclair had just
been drowned so near the same spot&mdash;think it safer to ride over
to him and put him across the river.&nbsp; The river was very low and
so clear that we could see every stone.&nbsp; On getting to the river-bed
we lit a fire and did the same on leaving it; our tracks would guide
anyone over the intervening ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides his occupation with the sheep, he found time to play the
piano, to read and to write.&nbsp; In the library of St. John&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge, are two copies of the Greek Testament, very fully
annotated by him at the University and in the colony.&nbsp; He also
read the <i>Origin of Species</i>, which, as everyone knows, was published
in 1859.&nbsp; He became &ldquo;one of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s many enthusiastic
admirers, and wrote a philosophic dialogue (the most offensive form,
except poetry and books of travel into supposed unknown countries, that
even literature can assume) upon the <i>Origin of Species</i>&rdquo;
(<i>Unconscious Memory</i>, close of Chapter I).&nbsp; This dialogue,
unsigned, was printed in the <i>Press</i>, Canterbury, New Zealand,
on 20th December, 1862.&nbsp; A copy of the paper was sent to Charles
Darwin, who forwarded it to a, presumably, English editor with a letter,
now in the Canterbury Museum, New Zealand, speaking of the dialogue
as &ldquo;remarkable from its spirit and from giving so clear and accurate
an account of Mr. D&rsquo;s theory.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is possible that
Butler himself sent the newspaper containing his dialogue to Mr. Darwin;
if so he did not disclose his name, for Darwin says in his letter that
he does not know who the author was.&nbsp; Butler was closely connected
with the <i>Press</i>, which was founded by James Edward FitzGerald,
the first Superintendent of the Province, in May, 1861; he frequently
contributed to its pages, and once, during FitzGerald&rsquo;s absence,
had charge of it for a short time, though he was never its actual editor.&nbsp;
The <i>Press</i> reprinted the dialogue and the correspondence which
followed its original appearance on 8th June, 1912.</p>
<p>On 13th June, 1863, the <i>Press</i> printed a letter by Butler signed
&ldquo;Cellarius&rdquo; and headed &ldquo;Darwin among the Machines,&rdquo;
reprinted in <i>The Note-Books of Samuel Butler</i> (1912).&nbsp; The
letter begins:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir: There are few things of which the present generation
is more justly proud than of the wonderful improvements which are daily
taking place in all sorts of mechanical appliances&rdquo;; and goes
on to say that, as the vegetable kingdom was developed from the mineral,
and as the animal kingdom supervened upon the vegetable, &ldquo;so now,
in the last few ages, an entirely new kingdom has sprung up of which
we as yet have only seen what will one day be considered the antediluvian
types of the race.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then speaks of the minute members
which compose the beautiful and intelligent little animal which we call
the watch, and of how it has gradually been evolved from the clumsy
brass clocks of the thirteenth century.&nbsp; Then comes the question:
Who will be man&rsquo;s successor?&nbsp; To which the answer is: We
are ourselves creating our own successors.&nbsp; Man will become to
the machine what the horse and the dog are to man; the conclusion being
that machines are, or are becoming, animate.&nbsp; In 1863 Butler&rsquo;s
family published in his name <i>A First Year in Canterbury Settlement</i>,
which, as the preface states, was compiled from his letters home, his
journal and extracts from two papers contributed to the <i>Eagle</i>.&nbsp;
These two papers had appeared in the <i>Eagle</i> as three articles
entitled &ldquo;Our Emigrant&rdquo; and signed &ldquo;Cellarius.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The proof sheets of the book went out to New Zealand for correction
and were sent back in the <i>Colombo</i>, which was as unfortunate as
the <i>Burmah</i>, for she was wrecked.&nbsp; The proofs, however, were
fished up, though so nearly washed out as to be almost undecipherable.&nbsp;
Butler would have been just as well pleased if they had remained at
the bottom of the Indian Ocean, for he never liked the book and always
spoke of it as being full of youthful priggishness; but I think he was
a little hard upon it.&nbsp; Years afterwards, in one of his later books,
after quoting two passages from Mr. Grant Allen and pointing out why
he considered the second to be a recantation of the first, he wrote:
&ldquo;When Mr. Allen does make stepping-stones of his dead selves he
jumps upon them to some tune.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he was perhaps a little
inclined to treat his own dead self too much in the same spirit.</p>
<p>Butler did very well with the sheep, sold out in 1864 and returned
via Callao to England.&nbsp; He travelled with three friends whose acquaintance
he had made in the colony; one was Charles Paine Pauli, to whom he dedicated
<i>Life and Habit</i>.&nbsp; He arrived in August, 1864, in London,
where he took chambers consisting of a sitting-room, a bedroom, a painting-room
and a pantry, at 15 Clifford&rsquo;s Inn, second floor (north).&nbsp;
The net financial result of the sheep-farming and the selling out was
that he practically doubled his capital, that is to say he had about
&pound;8000.&nbsp; This he left in New Zealand, invested on mortgage
at 10 per cent, the then current rate in the colony; it produced more
than enough for him to live upon in the very simple way that suited
him best, and life in the Inns of Court resembles life at Cambridge
in that it reduces the cares of housekeeping to a minimum; it suited
him so well that he never changed his rooms, remaining there thirty-eight
years till his death.</p>
<p>He was now his own master and able at last to turn to painting.&nbsp;
He studied at the art school in Streatham Street, Bloomsbury, which
had formerly been managed by Henry Sass, but, in Butler&rsquo;s time,
was being carried on by Francis Stephen Gary, son of the Rev. Henry
Francis Gary, who had been a school-fellow of Dr. Butler at Rugby and
is well known as the translator of Dante and the friend of Charles Lamb.&nbsp;
Among his fellow-students was Mr. H. R. Robertson, who told me that
the young artists got hold of the legend, which is in some of the books
about Lamb, that when Francis Stephen Gary was a boy and there was a
talk at his father&rsquo;s house as to what profession he should take
up, Lamb, who was present, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should make him an apo-po-pothe-Cary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They used to repeat this story freely among themselves, being, no
doubt, amused by the Lamb-like pun, but also enjoying the malicious
pleasure of hinting that it might have been as well for their art education
if the advice of the gentle humorist had been followed.&nbsp; Anyone
who wants to know what kind of an artist F. S. Cary was can see his
picture of Charles and Mary Lamb in the National Portrait Gallery.&nbsp;
In 1865 Butler sent from London to New Zealand an article entitled &ldquo;Lucubratio
Ebria,&rdquo; which was published in the <i>Press</i> of 29th July,
1865.&nbsp; It treated machines from a point of view different from
that adopted in &ldquo;Darwin among the Machines,&rdquo; and was one
of the steps that led to <i>Erewhon</i> and ultimately to <i>Life and
Habit</i>.&nbsp; The article is reproduced in <i>The Note-Books of Samuel
Butler</i> (1912).</p>
<p>Butler also studied art at South Kensington, but by 1867 he had begun
to go to Heatherley&rsquo;s School of Art in Newman Street, where he
continued going for many years.&nbsp; He made a number of friends at
Heatherley&rsquo;s, and among them Miss Eliza Mary Anne Savage.&nbsp;
There also he first met Charles Gogin, who, in 1896, painted the portrait
of Butler which is now in the National Portrait Gallery.&nbsp; He described
himself as an artist in the Post Office Directory, and between 1868
and 1876 exhibited at the Royal Academy about a dozen pictures, of which
the most important was &ldquo;Mr. Heatherley&rsquo;s Holiday,&rdquo;
hung on the line in 1874.&nbsp; He left it by his will to his college
friend Jason Smith, whose representatives, after his death, in 1910,
gave it to the nation and it is now in the National Gallery of British
Art.&nbsp; Mr. Heatherley never went away for a holiday; he once had
to go out of town on business and did not return till the next day;
one of the students asked him how he had got on, saying no doubt he
had enjoyed the change and that he must have found it refreshing to
sleep for once out of London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Heatherley, &ldquo;I did not like it.&nbsp;
Country air has no body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The consequence was that, whenever there was a holiday and the school
was shut, Heatherley employed the time in mending the skeleton; Butler&rsquo;s
picture represents him so engaged in a corner of the studio.&nbsp; In
this way he got his model for nothing.&nbsp; Sometimes he hung up a
looking-glass near one of his windows and painted his own portrait.&nbsp;
Many of these he painted out, but after his death we found a little
store of them in his rooms, some of the early ones very curious.&nbsp;
Of the best of them one is now at Canterbury, New Zealand, one at St.
John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and one at the Schools, Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>This is Butler&rsquo;s own account of himself, taken from a letter
to Sir Julius von Haast; although written in 1865 it is true of his
mode of life for many years:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been taking lessons in painting ever since I arrived,
I was always very fond of it and mean to stick to it; it suits me and
I am not without hopes that I shall do well at it.&nbsp; I live almost
the life of a recluse, seeing very few people and going nowhere that
I can help&mdash;I mean in the way of parties and so forth; if my friends
had their way they would fritter away my time without any remorse; but
I made a regular stand against it from the beginning and so, having
my time pretty much in my own hands, work hard; I find, as I am sure
you must find, that it is next to impossible to combine what is commonly
called society and work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the time saved from society was not all devoted to painting.&nbsp;
He modified his letter to the <i>Press</i> about &ldquo;Darwin among
the Machines&rdquo; and, so modified, it appeared in 1865 as &ldquo;The
Mechanical Creation&rdquo; in the <i>Reasoner</i>, a paper then published
in London by Mr. G. J. Holyoake.&nbsp; And his mind returned to the
considerations which had determined him to decline to be ordained.&nbsp;
In 1865 he printed anonymously a pamphlet which he had begun in New
Zealand, the result of his study of the Greek Testament, entitled <i>The
Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ as given by the four Evangelists
critically examined</i>.&nbsp; After weighing this evidence and comparing
one account with another, he came to the conclusion that Jesus Christ
did not die upon the cross.&nbsp; It is improbable that a man officially
executed should escape death, but the alternative, that a man actually
dead should return to life, seemed to Butler more improbable still and
unsupported by such evidence as he found in the gospels.&nbsp; From
this evidence he concluded that Christ swooned and recovered consciousness
after his body had passed into the keeping of Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a.&nbsp;
He did not suppose fraud on the part of the first preachers of Christianity;
they sincerely believed that Christ died and rose again.&nbsp; Joseph
and Nicodemus probably knew the truth but kept silence.&nbsp; The idea
of what might follow from belief in one single supposed miracle was
never hereafter absent from Butler&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>In 1869, having been working too hard, he went abroad for a long
change.&nbsp; On his way back, at the Albergo La Luna, in Venice, he
met an elderly Russian lady in whose company he spent most of his time
there.&nbsp; She was no doubt impressed by his versatility and charmed,
as everyone always was, by his conversation and original views on the
many subjects that interested him.&nbsp; We may be sure he told her
all about himself and what he had done and was intending to do.&nbsp;
At the end of his stay, when he was taking leave of her, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Et maintenant, Monsieur, vous allez cr&eacute;er,&rdquo; meaning,
as he understood her, that he had been looking long enough at the work
of others and should now do something of his own.</p>
<p>This sank into him and pained him.&nbsp; He was nearly thirty-five,
and hitherto all had been admiration, vague aspiration and despair;
he had produced in painting nothing but a few sketches and studies,
and in literature only a few ephemeral articles, a collection of youthful
letters and a pamphlet on the Resurrection; moreover, to none of his
work had anyone paid the slightest attention.&nbsp; This was a poor
return for all the money which had been spent upon his education, as
Theobald would have said in <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>.&nbsp; He returned
home dejected, but resolved that things should be different in the future.&nbsp;
While in this frame of mind he received a visit from one of his New
Zealand friends, the late Sir F. Napier Broome, afterwards Governor
of Western Australia, who incidentally suggested his rewriting his New
Zealand articles.&nbsp; The idea pleased him; it might not be creating,
but at least it would be doing something.&nbsp; So he set to work on
Sundays and in the evenings, as relaxation from his profession of painting,
and, taking his New Zealand article, &ldquo;Darwin among the Machines,&rdquo;
and another, &ldquo;The World of the Unborn,&rdquo; as a starting point
and helping himself with a few sentences from <i>A First Year in Canterbury
Settlement</i>, he gradually formed <i>Erewhon</i>.&nbsp; He sent the
MS. bit by bit, as it was written, to Miss Savage for her criticism
and approval.&nbsp; He had the usual difficulty about finding a publisher.&nbsp;
Chapman and Hall refused the book on the advice of George Meredith,
who was then their reader, and in the end he published it at his own
expense through Messrs. Tr&uuml;bner.</p>
<p>Mr. Sydney C. Cockerell told me that in 1912 Mr. Bertram Dobell,
second-hand bookseller of Charing Cross Road, offered a copy of <i>Erewhon</i>
for &pound;1 10s.; it was thus described in his catalogue: &ldquo;Unique
copy with the following note in the author&rsquo;s handwriting on the
half-title: &lsquo;To Miss E. M. A. Savage this first copy of <i>Erewhon</i>
with the author&rsquo;s best thanks for many invaluable suggestions
and corrections.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; When Mr. Cockerell inquired for
the book it was sold.&nbsp; After Miss Savage&rsquo;s death in 1885
all Butler&rsquo;s letters to her were returned to him, including the
letter he wrote when he sent her this copy of <i>Erewhon</i>.&nbsp;
He gave her the first copy issued of all his books that were published
in her lifetime, and, no doubt, wrote an inscription in each.&nbsp;
If the present possessors of any of them should happen to read this
sketch I hope they will communicate with me, as I should like to see
these books.&nbsp; I should also like to see some numbers of the <i>Drawing-Room
Gazette</i>, which about this time belonged to or was edited by a Mrs.
Briggs.&nbsp; Miss Savage wrote a review of <i>Erewhon</i>, which appeared
in the number for 8th June, 1872, and Butler quoted a sentence from
her review among the press notices in the second edition.&nbsp; She
persuaded him to write for Mrs. Briggs notices of concerts at which
Handel&rsquo;s music was performed.&nbsp; In 1901 he made a note on
one of his letters that he was thankful there were no copies of the
<i>Drawing-Room Gazette</i> in the British Museum, meaning that he did
not want people to read his musical criticisms; nevertheless, I hope
some day to come across back numbers containing his articles.</p>
<p>The opening of <i>Erewhon</i> is based upon Butler&rsquo;s colonial
experiences; some of the descriptions remind one of passages in <i>A
First Year in Canterbury Settlement</i>, where he speaks of the excursions
he made with Doctor when looking for sheep-country.&nbsp; The walk over
the range as far as the statues is taken from the Upper Rangitata district,
with some alterations; but the walk down from the statues into Erewhon
is reminiscent of the Leventina Valley in the Canton Ticino.&nbsp; The
great chords, which are like the music moaned by the statues, are from
the prelude to the first of Handel&rsquo;s <i>Trois Le&ccedil;ons</i>;
he used to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One feels them in the diaphragm&mdash;they are, as it were,
the groaning and labouring of all creation travailing together until
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a place in New Zealand named Erewhon, after the book; it
is marked on the large maps, a township about fifty miles west of Napier
in the Hawke Bay Province (North Island).&nbsp; I am told that people
in New Zealand sometimes call their houses Erewhon and occasionally
spell the word Erehwon which Butler did not intend; he treated wh as
a single letter, as one would treat th.&nbsp; Among other traces of
Erewhon now existing in real life are Butler&rsquo;s Stones on the Hokitika
Pass, so called because of a legend that they were in his mind when
he described the statues.</p>
<p>The book was translated into Dutch in 1873 and into German in 1897.</p>
<p>Butler wrote to Charles Darwin to explain what he meant by the &ldquo;Book
of the Machines&rdquo;: &ldquo;I am sincerely sorry that some of the
critics should have thought I was laughing at your theory, a thing which
I never meant to do and should be shocked at having done.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Soon after this Butler was invited to Down and paid two visits to Mr.
Darwin there; he thus became acquainted with all the family and for
some years was on intimate terms with Mr. (now Sir) Francis Darwin.</p>
<p>It is easy to see by the light of subsequent events that we should
probably have had something not unlike <i>Erewhon</i> sooner or later,
even without the Russian lady and Sir F. N. Broome, to whose promptings,
owing to a certain diffidence which never left him, he was perhaps inclined
to attribute too much importance.&nbsp; But he would not have agreed
with this view at the time; he looked upon himself as a painter and
upon <i>Erewhon</i> as an interruption.&nbsp; It had come, like one
of those creatures from the Land of the Unborn, pestering him and refusing
to leave him at peace until he consented to give it bodily shape.&nbsp;
It was only a little one, and he saw no likelihood of its having any
successors.&nbsp; So he satisfied its demands and then, supposing that
he had written himself out, looked forward to a future in which nothing
should interfere with the painting.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when another
of the unborn came teasing him he yielded to its importunities and allowed
himself to become the author of <i>The Fair Haven</i>, which is his
pamphlet on the Resurrection, enlarged and preceded by a realistic memoir
of the pseudonymous author, John Pickard Owen.&nbsp; In the library
of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, are two copies of the pamphlet
with pages cut out; he used these pages in forming the MS. of <i>The
Fair Haven</i>.&nbsp; To have published this book as by the author of
<i>Erewhon</i> would have been to give away the irony and satire.&nbsp;
And he had another reason for not disclosing his name; he remembered
that as soon as curiosity about the authorship of <i>Erewhon</i> was
satisfied, the weekly sales fell from fifty down to only two or three.&nbsp;
But, as he always talked openly of whatever was in his mind, he soon
let out the secret of the authorship of <i>The Fair Haven</i>, and it
became advisable to put his name to a second edition.</p>
<p>One result of his submitting the MS. of <i>Erewhon</i> to Miss Savage
was that she thought he ought to write a novel, and urged him to do
so.&nbsp; I have no doubt that he wrote the memoir of John Pickard Owen
with the idea of quieting Miss Savage and also as an experiment to ascertain
whether he was likely to succeed with a novel.&nbsp; The result seems
to have satisfied him, for, not long after <i>The Fair Haven</i>, he
began <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>, sending the MS. to Miss Savage, as
he did everything he wrote, for her approval and putting her into the
book as Ernest&rsquo;s Aunt Alethea.&nbsp; He continued writing it in
the intervals of other work until her death in February, 1885, after
which he did not touch it.&nbsp; It was published in 1903 by Mr. R.
A. Streatfeild, his literary executor.</p>
<p>Soon after <i>The Fair Haven</i> Butler began to be aware that his
letter in the <i>Press</i>, &ldquo;Darwin among the Machines,&rdquo;
was descending with further modifications and developing in his mind
into a theory about evolution which took shape as <i>Life and Habit</i>;
but the writing of this very remarkable and suggestive book was delayed
and the painting interrupted by absence from England on business in
Canada.&nbsp; He had been persuaded by a college friend, a member of
one of the great banking families, to call in his colonial mortgages
and to put the money into several new companies.&nbsp; He was going
to make thirty or forty per cent instead of only ten.&nbsp; One of these
companies was a Canadian undertaking, of which he became a director;
it was necessary for someone to go to headquarters and investigate its
affairs; he went, and was much occupied by the business for two or three
years.&nbsp; By the beginning of 1876 he had returned finally to London,
but most of his money was lost and his financial position for the next
ten years caused him very serious anxiety.&nbsp; His personal expenditure
was already so low that it was hardly possible to reduce it, and he
set to work at his profession more industriously than ever, hoping to
paint something that he could sell, his spare time being occupied with
<i>Life and Habit</i>, which was the subject that really interested
him more deeply than any other.</p>
<p>Following his letter in the <i>Press</i>, wherein he had seen machines
as in process of becoming animate, he went on to regard them as living
organs and limbs which we had made outside ourselves.&nbsp; What would
follow if we reversed this and regarded our limbs and organs as machines
which we had manufactured as parts of our bodies?&nbsp; In the first
place, how did we come to make them without knowing anything about it?&nbsp;
But then, how comes anybody to do anything unconsciously?&nbsp; The
answer usually would be: By habit.&nbsp; But can a man be said to do
a thing by habit when he has never done it before?&nbsp; His ancestors
have done it, but not he.&nbsp; Can the habit have been acquired by
them for his benefit?&nbsp; Not unless he and his ancestors are the
same person.&nbsp; Perhaps, then, they are the same person.</p>
<p>In February, 1876, partly to clear his mind and partly to tell someone,
he wrote down his thoughts in a letter to his namesake, Thomas William
Gale Butler, a fellow art-student who was then in New Zealand; so much
of the letter as concerns the growth of his theory is given in <i>The
Note-Books of Samuel Butler</i> (1912) and a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of
the theory will be found at the end of the last of the essays in this
volume, &ldquo;The Deadlock in Darwinism.&rdquo;&nbsp; In September,
1877, when <i>Life and Habit</i> was on the eve of publication, Mr.
Francis Darwin came to lunch with him in Clifford&rsquo;s Inn and, in
course of conversation, told him that Professor Ray Lankester had written
something in <i>Nature</i> about a lecture by Dr. Ewald Hering of Prague,
delivered so long ago as 1870, &ldquo;On Memory as a Universal Function
of Organized Matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; This rather alarmed Butler, but he
deferred looking up the reference until after December, 1877, when his
book was out, and then, to his relief, he found that Hering&rsquo;s
theory was very similar to his own, so that, instead of having something
sprung upon him which would have caused him to want to alter his book,
he was supported.&nbsp; He at once wrote to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
calling attention to Hering&rsquo;s lecture, and then pursued his studies
in evolution.</p>
<p><i>Life and Habit</i> was followed in 1879 by <i>Evolution Old and
New</i>, wherein he compared the teleological or purposive view of evolution
taken by Buffon, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck with the view taken
by Charles Darwin, and came to the conclusion that the old was better.&nbsp;
But while agreeing with the earlier writers in thinking that the variations
whose accumulation results in species were originally due to intelligence,
he could not take the view that the intelligence resided in an external
personal God.&nbsp; He had done with all that when he gave up the Resurrection
of Jesus Christ from the dead.&nbsp; He proposed to place the intelligence
inside the creature (&ldquo;The Deadlock in Darwinism&rdquo; post).</p>
<p>In 1880 he continued the subject by publishing <i>Unconscious Memory</i>.&nbsp;
Chapter IV of this book is concerned with a personal quarrel between
himself and Charles Darwin which arose out of the publication by Charles
Darwin of Dr. Krause&rsquo;s <i>Life of Erasmus Darwin</i>.&nbsp; We
need not enter into particulars here, the matter is fully dealt with
in a pamphlet, <i>Charles Darwin and Samuel Butler: A Step towards Reconciliation</i>,
which I wrote in 1911, the result of a correspondence between Mr. Francis
Darwin and myself.&nbsp; Before this correspondence took place Mr. Francis
Darwin had made several public allusions to <i>Life and Habit</i>; and
in September, 1908, in his inaugural address to the British Association
at Dublin, he did Butler the posthumous honour of quoting from his translation
of Hering&rsquo;s lecture &ldquo;On Memory,&rdquo; which is in <i>Unconscious
Memory</i>, and of mentioning Butler as having enunciated the theory
contained in <i>Life and Habit.</i></p>
<p>In 1886 Butler published his last book on evolution, <i>Luck or Cunning
as the Main Means of Organic Modification</i>?&nbsp; His other contributions
to the subject are some essays, written for the <i>Examiner</i> in 1879,
&ldquo;God the Known and God the Unknown,&rdquo; which were re-published
by Mr. Fifield in 1909, and the articles &ldquo;The Deadlock in Darwinism&rdquo;
which appeared in the <i>Universal Review</i> in 1890 and are contained
in this volume; some further notes on evolution will be found in <i>The
Note-Books of Samuel Butler</i> (1912).</p>
<p>It was while he was writing <i>Life and Habit</i> that I first met
him.&nbsp; For several years he had been in the habit of spending six
or eight weeks of the summer in Italy and the Canton Ticino, generally
making Faido his headquarters.&nbsp; Many a page of his books was written
while resting by the fountain of some subalpine village or waiting in
the shade of the chestnuts till the light came so that he could continue
a sketch.&nbsp; Every year he returned home by a different route, and
thus gradually became acquainted with every part of the Canton and North
Italy.&nbsp; There is scarcely a town or village, a point of view, a
building, statue or picture in all this country with which he was not
familiar.&nbsp; In 1878 he happened to be on the Sacro Monte above Varese
at the time I took my holiday; there I joined him, and nearly every
year afterwards we were in Italy together.</p>
<p>He was always a delightful companion, and perhaps at his gayest on
these occasions.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s holiday,&rdquo; he would
say, &ldquo;is his garden,&rdquo; and he set out to enjoy himself and
to make everyone about him enjoy themselves too.&nbsp; I told him the
old schoolboy muddle about Sir Walter Raleigh introducing tobacco and
saying: &ldquo;We shall this day light up such a fire in England as
I trust shall never be put out.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had not heard it before
and, though amused, appeared preoccupied, and perhaps a little jealous,
during the rest of the evening.&nbsp; Next morning, while he was pouring
out his coffee, his eyes twinkled and he said, with assumed carelessness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the by, do you remember?&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it Columbus
who bashed the egg down on the table and said &lsquo;Eppur non si muove&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was welcome wherever he went, full of fun and ready to play while
doing the honours of the country.&nbsp; Many of the peasants were old
friends, and every day we were sure to meet someone who remembered him.&nbsp;
Perhaps it would be an old woman labouring along under a burden; she
would smile and stop, take his hand and tell him how happy she was to
meet him again and repeat her thanks for the empty wine bottle he had
given her after an out-of-door luncheon in her neighbourhood four or
five years before.&nbsp; There was another who had rowed him many times
across the Lago di Orta and had never been in a train but once in her
life, when she went to Novara to her son&rsquo;s wedding.&nbsp; He always
remembered all about these people and asked how the potatoes were doing
this year and whether the grandchildren were growing up into fine boys
and girls, and he never forgot to inquire after the son who had gone
to be a waiter in New York.&nbsp; At Civiasco there is a restaurant
which used to be kept by a jolly old lady, known for miles round as
La Martina; we always lunched with her on our way over the Colma to
and from Varallo-Sesia.&nbsp; On one occasion we were accompanied by
two English ladies and, one being a teetotaller, Butler maliciously
instructed La Martina to make the <i>sabbaglione</i> so that it should
be <i>forte</i> and <i>abbondante</i>, and to say that the Marsala,
with which it was more than flavoured, was nothing but vinegar.&nbsp;
La Martina never forgot that when she looked in to see how things were
going, he was pretending to lick the dish clean.&nbsp; These journeys
provided the material for a book which he thought of calling &ldquo;Verdi
Prati,&rdquo; after one of Handel&rsquo;s most beautiful songs; but
he changed his mind, and it appeared at the end of 1881 as <i>Alps and
Sanctuaries of Piedmont and the Canton Ticino</i> with more than eighty
illustrations, nearly all by Butler.&nbsp; Charles Gogin made an etching
for the frontispiece, drew some of the pictures, and put figures into
others; half a dozen are mine.&nbsp; They were all redrawn in ink from
sketches made on the spot, in oil, water-colour, and pencil.&nbsp; There
were also many illustrations of another kind&mdash;extracts from Handel&rsquo;s
music, each chosen because Butler thought it suitable to the spirit
of the scene he wished to bring before the reader.&nbsp; The introduction
concludes with these words: &ldquo;I have chosen Italy as my second
country, and would dedicate this book to her as a thank-offering for
the happiness she has afforded me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spring of 1883 he began to compose music, and in 1885 we published
together an album of minuets, gavottes, and fugues.&nbsp; This led to
our writing <i>Narcissus</i>, which is an Oratorio Buffo in the Handelian
manner&mdash;that is as nearly so as we could make it.&nbsp; It is a
mistake to suppose that all Handel&rsquo;s oratorios are upon sacred
subjects; some of them are secular.&nbsp; And not only so, but, whatever
the subject, Handel was never at a loss in treating anything that came
into his words by way of allusion or illustration.&nbsp; As Butler puts
it in one of his sonnets:</p>
<blockquote><p>He who gave eyes to ears and showed in sound<br />
All thoughts and things in earth or heaven above&mdash;<br />
From fire and hailstones running along the ground<br />
To Galatea grieving for her love&mdash;<br />
He who could show to all unseeing eyes<br />
Glad shepherds watching o&rsquo;er their flocks by night,<br />
Or Iphis angel-wafted to the skies,<br />
Or Jordan standing as an heap upright&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so on.&nbsp; But there is one subject which Handel never treated&mdash;I
mean the Money Market.&nbsp; Perhaps he avoided it intentionally; he
was twice bankrupt, and Mr. R. A. Streatfeild tells me that the British
Museum possesses a MS. letter from him giving instructions as to the
payment of the dividends on &pound;500 South Sea Stock.&nbsp; Let us
hope he sold out before the bubble burst; if so, he was more fortunate
than Butler, who was at this time of his life in great anxiety about
his own financial affairs.&nbsp; It seemed a pity that Dr. Morell had
never offered Handel some such words as these:</p>
<blockquote><p>The steadfast funds maintain their wonted state<br />
While all the other markets fluctuate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Butler wondered whether Handel would have sent the steadfast funds
up above par and maintained them on an inverted pedal with all the other
markets fluctuating iniquitously round them like the sheep that turn
every one to his own way in the <i>Messiah</i>.&nbsp; He thought something
of the kind ought to have been done, and in the absence of Handel and
Dr. Morell we determined to write an oratorio that should attempt to
supply the want.&nbsp; In order to make our libretto as plausible as
possible, we adopted the dictum of Monsieur Jourdain&rsquo;s Ma&icirc;tre
&agrave; danser: &ldquo;Lorsqu&rsquo;on a des personnes &agrave; faire
parler en musique, il faut bien que, pour la vraisemblance, on donne
dans la bergerie.&rdquo;&nbsp; Narcissus is accordingly a shepherd in
love with Amaryllis; they come to London with other shepherds and lose
their money in imprudent speculations on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp; In
the second part the aunt and godmother of Narcissus, having died at
an advanced age worth one hundred thousand pounds, all of which she
has bequeathed to her nephew and godson, the obstacle to his union with
Amaryllis is removed.&nbsp; The money is invested in consols and all
ends happily.</p>
<p>In December, 1886, Butler&rsquo;s father died, and his financial
difficulties ceased.&nbsp; He engaged Alfred Emery Cathie as clerk,
but made no other change, except that he bought a pair of new hair brushes
and a larger wash-hand basin.&nbsp; Any change in his mode of life was
an event.&nbsp; When in London he got up at 6.30 in the summer and 7.30
in the winter, went into his sitting-room, lighted the fire, put the
kettle on and returned to bed.&nbsp; In half an hour he got up again,
fetched the kettle of hot water, emptied it into the cold water that
was already in his bath, refilled the kettle and put it back on the
fire.&nbsp; After dressing, he came into his sitting-room, made tea
and cooked, in his Dutch oven, something he had bought the day before.&nbsp;
His laundress was an elderly woman, and he could not trouble her to
come to his rooms so early in the morning; on the other hand, he could
not stay in bed until he thought it right for her to go out; so it ended
in his doing a great deal for himself.&nbsp; He then got his breakfast
and read the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; At 9.30 Alfred came, with whom he discussed
anything requiring attention, and soon afterwards his laundress arrived.&nbsp;
Then he started to walk to the British Museum, where he arrived about
10.30, every alternate morning calling at the butcher&rsquo;s in Fetter
Lane to order his meat.&nbsp; In the Reading Room at the Museum he sat
at Block B (&ldquo;B for Butler&rdquo;) and spent an hour &ldquo;posting
his notes&rdquo;&mdash;that is reconsidering, rewriting, amplifying,
shortening, and indexing the contents of the little note-book he always
carried in his pocket.&nbsp; After the notes he went on till 1.30 with
whatever book he happened to be writing.</p>
<p>On three days of the week he dined in a restaurant on his way home,
and on the other days he dined in his chambers where his laundress had
cooked his dinner.&nbsp; At two o&rsquo;clock Alfred returned (having
been home to dinner with his wife and children) and got tea ready for
him.&nbsp; He then wrote letters and attended to his accounts till 3.45,
when he smoked his first cigarette.&nbsp; He used to smoke a great deal,
but, believing it to be bad for him, took to cigarettes instead of pipes,
and gradually smoked less and less, making it a rule not to begin till
some particular hour, and pushing this hour later and later in the day,
till it settled itself at 3.45.&nbsp; There was no water laid on in
his rooms, and every day he fetched one can full from the tap in the
court, Alfred fetching the rest.&nbsp; When anyone expostulated with
him about cooking his own breakfast and fetching his own water, he replied
that it was good for him to have a change of occupation.&nbsp; This
was partly the fact, but the real reason, which he could not tell everyone,
was that he shrank from inconveniencing anybody; he always paid more
than was necessary when anything was done for him, and was not happy
then unless he did some of the work himself.</p>
<p>At 5.30 he got his evening meal, he called it his tea, and it was
little more than a facsimile of breakfast.&nbsp; Alfred left in time
to post the letters before six.&nbsp; Butler then wrote music till about
8, when he came to see me in Staple Inn, returning to Clifford&rsquo;s
Inn by about 10.&nbsp; After a light supper, latterly not more than
a piece of toast and a glass of milk, he played one game of his own
particular kind of Patience, prepared his breakfast things and fire
ready for the next morning, smoked his seventh and last cigarette, and
went to bed at eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>He was fond of the theatre, but avoided serious pieces.&nbsp; He
preferred to take his Shakespeare from the book, finding that the spirit
of the plays rather evaporated under modern theatrical treatment.&nbsp;
In one of his books he brightens up the old illustration of <i>Hamlet</i>
without the Prince of Denmark by putting it thus: &ldquo;If the character
of Hamlet be entirely omitted, the play must suffer, even though Henry
Irving himself be cast for the title-role.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anyone going
to the theatre in this spirit would be likely to be less disappointed
by performances that were comic or even frankly farcical.&nbsp; Latterly,
when he grew slightly deaf, listening to any kind of piece became too
much of an effort; nevertheless, he continued to the last the habit
of going to one pantomime every winter.</p>
<p>There were about twenty houses where he visited, but he seldom accepted
an invitation to dinner&mdash;it upset the regularity of his life; besides,
he belonged to no club and had no means of returning hospitality.&nbsp;
When two colonial friends called unexpectedly about noon one day, soon
after he settled in London, he went to the nearest cook-shop in Fetter
Lane and returned carrying a dish of hot roast pork and greens.&nbsp;
This was all very well once in a way, but not the sort of thing to be
repeated indefinitely.</p>
<p>On Thursdays, instead of going to the Museum, he often took a day
off, going into the country sketching or walking, and on Sundays, whatever
the weather, he nearly always went into the country walking; his map
of the district for thirty miles round London is covered all over with
red lines showing where he had been.&nbsp; He sometimes went out of
town from Saturday to Monday, and for over twenty years spent Christmas
at Boulogne-sur-Mer.</p>
<p>There is a Sacro Monte at Varallo-Sesia with many chapels, each containing
life-sized statues and frescoes illustrating the life of Christ.&nbsp;
Butler had visited this sanctuary repeatedly, and was a great favourite
with the townspeople, who knew that he was studying the statues and
frescoes in the chapels, and who remembered that in the preface to <i>Alps
and Sanctuaries</i> he had declared his intention of writing about them.&nbsp;
In August, 1887, the Varallesi brought matters to a head by giving him
a civic dinner on the Mountain.&nbsp; Everyone was present, there were
several speeches and, when we were coming down the slippery mountain
path after it was all over, he said to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, there&rsquo;s nothing for it now but to write that
book about the Sacro Monte at once.&nbsp; It must be the next thing
I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, on returning home, he took up photography and, immediately
after Christmas, went back to Varallo to photograph the statues and
collect material.&nbsp; Much research was necessary and many visits
to out-of-the-way sanctuaries which might have contained work by the
sculptor Tabachetti, whom he was rescuing from oblivion and identifying
with the Flemish Jean de Wespin.&nbsp; One of these visits, made after
his book was published, forms the subject of &ldquo;The Sanctuary of
Montrigone,&rdquo; reproduced in this volume.&nbsp; <i>Ex Voto</i>,
the book about Varallo, appeared in 1888, and an Italian translation
by Cavaliere Angelo Rizzetti was published at Novara in 1894.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quis Desiderio . . .?&rdquo; the second essay in this volume,
was developed in 1888 from something in a letter from Miss Savage nearly
ten years earlier.&nbsp; On the 15th of December, 1878, in acknowledging
this letter, Butler wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am sure that any tree or flower nursed by Miss Cobbe
would be the very first to fade away and that her gazelles would die
long before they ever came to know her well.&nbsp; The sight of the
brass buttons on her pea-jacket would settle them out of hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was an enclosure in Miss Savage&rsquo;s letter, but it is unfortunately
lost; I suppose it must have been a newspaper cutting with an allusion
to Moore&rsquo;s poem and perhaps a portrait of Miss Frances Power Cobbe&mdash;pea-jacket,
brass buttons, and all.</p>
<p>On the 10th November, 1879, Miss Savage, having been ill, wrote to
Butler:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been dipping into the books of Moses, being sometimes
at a loss for something to read while shut up in my apartment.&nbsp;
You know that I have never read the Bible much, consequently there is
generally something of a novelty that I hit on.&nbsp; As you do know
your Bible well, perhaps you can tell me what became of Aaron.&nbsp;
The account given of his end in Numbers XX is extremely ambiguous and
unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Evidently he did not come by his death fairly,
but whether he was murdered secretly for the furtherance of some private
ends, or publicly in a State sacrifice, I can&rsquo;t make out.&nbsp;
I myself rather incline to the former opinion, but I should like to
know what the experts say about it.&nbsp; A very nice, exciting little
tale might be made out of it in the style of the police stories in All
the Year Round called &ldquo;The Mystery of Mount Hor or What became
of Aaron?&rdquo;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget to write to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Butler&rsquo;s people had been suggesting that he should try to earn
money by writing in magazines, and Miss Savage was falling in with the
idea and offering a practical suggestion.&nbsp; I do not find that he
had anything to tell her about the death of Aaron.&nbsp; On 23rd March,
1880, she wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Mr. Butler: Read the subjoined poem of Wordsworth
and let me know what you understand its meaning to be.&nbsp; Of course
I have my opinion, which I think of communicating to the Wordsworth
Society.&nbsp; You can belong to that Society for the small sum of 2/6
per annum.&nbsp; I think of joining because it is cheap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The subjoined poem&rdquo; was the one beginning: &ldquo;She
dwelt among the untrodden ways,&rdquo; and Butler made this note on
the letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>To the foregoing letter I answered that I concluded Miss
Savage meant to imply that Wordsworth had murdered Lucy in order to
escape a prosecution for breach of promise.</p>
<p>Miss Savage to Butler.</p>
<p>2nd April, 1880: My dear Mr. Butler: I don&rsquo;t think you see
all that I do in the poem, and I am afraid that the suggestion of a
DARK SECRET in the poet&rsquo;s life is not so very obvious after all.&nbsp;
I was hoping you would propose to devote yourself for a few months to
reading the Excursion, his letters, &amp;c., with a view to following
up the clue, and I am disappointed though, to say the truth, the idea
of a crime had not flashed upon me when I wrote to you.&nbsp; How well
the works of great men repay attention and study!&nbsp; But you, who
know your Bible so well, how was it that you did not detect the plagiarism
in the last verse?&nbsp; Just refer to the account of the disappearance
of Aaron (I have not a Bible at hand, we want one sadly in the club)
but I am sure that the words are identical [I cannot see what Miss Savage
meant.&nbsp; 1901.&nbsp; S. B.]&nbsp; Cassell&rsquo;s Magazine have
offered a prize for setting the poem to music, and I fell to thinking
how it could be treated musically, and so came to a right comprehension
of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Butler, when editing Miss Savage&rsquo;s letters in 1901,
could not see the resemblance between Wordsworth&rsquo;s poem and Numbers
XX., he at once saw a strong likeness between Lucy and Moore&rsquo;s
heroine whom he had been keeping in an accessible pigeon-hole of his
memory ever since his letter about Miss Frances Power Cobbe.&nbsp; He
now sent Lucy to keep her company and often spoke of the pair of them
as probably the two most disagreeable young women in English literature&mdash;an
opinion which he must have expressed to Miss Savage and with which I
have no doubt she agreed.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1888, on his return from photographing the statues
at Varallo, he found, to his disgust, that the authorities of the British
Museum had removed Frost&rsquo;s <i>Lives of Eminent Christians</i>
from its accustomed shelf in the Reading Room.&nbsp; Soon afterwards
Harry Quilter asked him to write for the <i>Universal Review</i> and
he responded with &ldquo;Quis Desiderio . . .?&rdquo;&nbsp; In this
essay he compares himself to Wordsworth and dwells on the points of
resemblance between Lucy and the book of whose assistance he had now
been deprived in a passage which echoes the opening of Chapter V of
<i>Ex Voto</i>, where he points out the resemblances between Varallo
and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Early in 1888 the leading members of the Shrewsbury Arch&aelig;ological
Society asked Butler to write a memoir of his grandfather and of his
father for their Quarterly Journal.&nbsp; This he undertook to do when
he should have finished <i>Ex Voto</i>.&nbsp; In December, 1888, his
sisters, with the idea of helping him to write the memoir, gave him
his grandfather&rsquo;s correspondence, which extended from 1790 to
1839.&nbsp; On looking over these very voluminous papers he became penetrated
with an almost Chinese reverence for his ancestor and, after getting
the Arch&aelig;ological Society to absolve him from his promise to write
the memoir, set about a full life of Dr. Butler, which was not published
till 1896.&nbsp; The delay was caused partly by the immense quantity
of documents he had to sift and digest, the number of people he had
to consult and the many letters he had to write, and partly by something
that arose out of <i>Narcissus</i>, which we published in June, 1888.</p>
<p>Butler was not satisfied with having written only half of this work;
he wanted it to have a successor, so that by adding his two halves together,
he could say he had written a whole Handelian oratorio.&nbsp; While
staying with his sisters at Shrewsbury with this idea in his mind, he
casually took up a book by Alfred Ainger about Charles Lamb and therein
stumbled upon something about the <i>Odyssey</i>.&nbsp; It was years
since he had looked at the poem, but, from what he remembered, he thought
it might provide a suitable subject for musical treatment.&nbsp; He
did not, however, want to put Dr. Butler aside, so I undertook to investigate.&nbsp;
It is stated on the title-page of both <i>Narcissus</i> and <i>Ulysses</i>
that the words were written and the music composed by both of us.&nbsp;
As to the music, each piece bears the initials of the one who actually
composed it.&nbsp; As to the words, it was necessary first to settle
some general scheme and this, in the case of <i>Narcissus</i>, grew
in the course of conversation.&nbsp; The scheme of <i>Ulysses</i> was
constructed in a more formal way and Butler had perhaps rather less
to do with it.&nbsp; We were bound by the <i>Odyssey</i>, which is,
of course, too long to be treated fully, and I selected incidents that
attracted me and settled the order of the songs and choruses.&nbsp;
For this purpose, as I out-Shakespeare Shakespeare in the smallness
of my Greek, I used <i>The Adventures of Ulysses</i> by Charles Lamb,
which we should have known nothing about but for Ainger&rsquo;s book.&nbsp;
Butler acquiesced in my proposals, but, when it came to the words themselves,
he wrote practically all the libretto, as he had done in the case of
<i>Narcissus</i>; I did no more than suggest a few phrases and a few
lines here and there.</p>
<p>We had sent <i>Narcissus</i> for review to the papers, and, as a
consequence, about this time, made the acquaintance of Mr. J. A. Fuller
Maitland, then musical critic of the <i>Times</i>; he introduced us
to that learned musician William Smith Rockstro, under whom we studied
medieval counterpoint while composing <i>Ulysses</i>.&nbsp; We had already
made some progress with it when it occurred to Butler that it would
not take long and might, perhaps, be safer if he were to look at the
original poem, just to make sure that Lamb had not misled me.&nbsp;
Not having forgotten all his Greek, he bought a copy of the <i>Odyssey</i>
and was so fascinated by it that he could not put it down.&nbsp; When
he came to the Ph&oelig;acian episode of Ulysses at Scheria he felt
he must be reading the description of a real place and that something
in the personality of the author was eluding him.&nbsp; For months he
was puzzled, and, to help in clearing up the mystery, set about translating
the poem.&nbsp; In August, 1891, he had preceded me to Chiavenna and
on a letter I wrote him, telling him when to expect me, he made this
note:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was during the few days I was at Chiavenna (at the
Hotel Grotta Crim&eacute;e) that I hit upon the feminine authorship
of the Odyssey.&nbsp; I did not find out its having been written at
Trapani till January, 1892.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He suspected that the authoress in describing both Scheria and Ithaca
was drawing from her native country and searched on the Admiralty charts
for the features enumerated in the poem; this led him to the conclusion
that the country could only be Trapani, Mount Eryx, and the &AElig;gadean
Islands.&nbsp; As soon as he could after this discovery he went to Sicily
to study the locality and found it in all respects suitable for his
theory; indeed, it was astonishing how things kept turning up to support
his view.&nbsp; It is all in his book <i>The Authoress of the Odyssey</i>,
published in 1897 and dedicated to his friend Cavaliere Biagio Ingroja
of Calatafimi.</p>
<p>His first visit to Sicily was in 1892, in August&mdash;a hot time
of the year, but it was his custom to go abroad in the autumn.&nbsp;
He returned to Sicily every year (except one), but latterly went in
the spring.&nbsp; He made many friends all over the island, and after
his death the people of Calatafimi called a street by his name, the
Via Samuel Butler, &ldquo;thus,&rdquo; as Ingroja wrote when he announced
the event to me, &ldquo;honouring a great man&rsquo;s memory, handing
down his name to posterity, and doing homage to the friendly English
nation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Besides showing that the <i>Odyssey</i> was written
by a woman in Sicily and translating the poem into English prose, he
also translated the <i>Iliad</i>, and, in March, 1895, went to Greece
and the Troad to see the country therein described, where he found nothing
to cause him to disagree with the received theories.</p>
<p>It has been said of him in a general way that the fact of an opinion
being commonly held was enough to make him profess the opposite.&nbsp;
It was enough to make him examine the opinion for himself, when it affected
any of the many subjects which interested him, and if, after giving
it his best attention, he found it did not hold water, then no weight
of authority could make him say that it did.&nbsp; This matter of the
geography of the <i>Iliad</i> is only one among many commonly received
opinions which he examined for himself and found no reason to dispute;
on these he considered it unnecessary to write.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of his passion for doing things thoroughly that
he learnt nearly the whole of the <i>Odyssey</i> and the <i>Iliad</i>
by heart.&nbsp; He had a Pickering copy of each poem, which he carried
in his pocket and referred to in railway trains, both in England and
Italy, when saying the poems over to himself.&nbsp; These two little
books are now in the library of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.&nbsp;
He was, however, disappointed to find that he could not retain more
than a book or two at a time and that, on learning more, he forgot what
he had learnt first; but he was about sixty at the time.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Sonnets, on which he published a book in 1899, gave him less trouble
in this respect; he knew them all by heart, and also their order, and
one consequence of this was that he wrote some sonnets in the Shakespearian
form.&nbsp; He found this intimate knowledge of the poet&rsquo;s work
more useful for his purpose than reading commentaries by those who were
less familiar with it.&nbsp; &ldquo;A commentary on a poem,&rdquo; he
would say, &ldquo;may be useful as material on which to form an estimate
of the commentator, but the poem itself is the most important document
you can consult, and it is impossible to know it too intimately if you
want to form an opinion about it and its author.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was always the author, the work of God, that interested him more
than the book&mdash;the work of man; the painter more than the picture;
the composer more than the music.&nbsp; &ldquo;If a writer, a painter,
or a musician makes me feel that he held those things to be lovable
which I myself hold to be lovable I am satisfied; art is only interesting
in so far as it reveals the personality of the artist.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Handel was, of course, &ldquo;the greatest of all musicians.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Among the painters he chiefly loved Giovanni Bellini, Carpaccio, Gaudenzio
Ferrari, Rembrandt, Holbein, Velasquez, and De Hooghe; in poetry Shakespeare,
Homer, and the Authoress of the <i>Odyssey</i>; and in architecture
the man, whoever he was, who designed the Temple of Neptune at Paestum.&nbsp;
Life being short, he did not see why he should waste any of it in the
company of inferior people when he had these.&nbsp; And he treated those
he met in daily life in the same spirit: it was what he found them to
be that attracted or repelled him; what others thought about them was
of little or no consequence.</p>
<p>And now, at the end of his life, his thoughts reverted to the two
subjects which had occupied him more than thirty years previously&mdash;namely,
<i>Erewhon</i> and the evidence for the death and resurrection of Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; The idea of what might follow from belief in one single
supposed miracle had been slumbering during all those years and at last
rose again in the form of a sequel to <i>Erewhon</i>.&nbsp; In <i>Erewhon
Revisited</i> Mr. Higgs returns to find that the Erewhonians now believe
in him as a god in consequence of the supposed miracle of his going
up in a balloon to induce his heavenly father to send the rain.&nbsp;
Mr. Higgs and the reader know that there was no miracle in the case,
but Butler wanted to show that whether it was a miracle or not did not
signify provided that the people believed it to be one.&nbsp; And so
Mr. Higgs is present in the temple which is being dedicated to him and
his worship.</p>
<p>The existence of his son George was an after-thought and gave occasion
for the second leading idea of the book&mdash;the story of a father
trying to win the love of a hitherto unknown son by risking his life
in order to show himself worthy of it&mdash;and succeeding.</p>
<p>Butler&rsquo;s health had already begun to fail, and when he started
for Sicily on Good Friday, 1902, it was for the last time: he knew he
was unfit to travel, but was determined to go, and was looking forward
to meeting Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Fuller Maitland, whom he was to accompany
over the Odyssean scenes at Trapani and Mount Eryx.&nbsp; But he did
not get beyond Palermo; there he was so much worse that he could not
leave his room.&nbsp; In a few weeks he was well enough to be removed
to Naples, and Alfred went out and brought him home to London.&nbsp;
He was taken to a nursing home in St. John&rsquo;s Wood where he lay
for a month, attended by his old friend Dr. Dudgeon, and where he died
on the 18th June, 1902.</p>
<p>There was a great deal he still wanted to do.&nbsp; He had intended
to revise <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>, to write a book about Tabachetti,
and to publish a new edition of <i>Ex Voto</i> with the mistakes corrected.&nbsp;
Also he wished to reconsider the articles reprinted in this volume and
was looking forward to painting more sketches and composing more music.&nbsp;
While lying ill and very feeble within a few days of the end, and not
knowing whether it was to be the end or not, he said to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much better to-day.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t feel at all as
though I were going to die.&nbsp; Of course, it will be all wrong if
I do get well, for there is my literary position to be considered.&nbsp;
First I write <i>Erewhon</i>&mdash;that is my opening subject; then,
after modulating freely through all my other books and the music and
so on, I return gracefully to my original key and write <i>Erewhon Revisited</i>.&nbsp;
Obviously, now is the proper moment to come to a full close, make my
bow and retire; but I believe I am getting well after all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
very inartistic, but I cannot help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of his readers complain that they often do not know whether
he is serious or jesting.&nbsp; He wrote of Lord Beaconsfield: &ldquo;Earnestness
was his greatest danger, but if he did not quite overcome it (as indeed
who can? it is the last enemy that shall be subdued), he managed to
veil it with a fair amount of success.&rdquo;&nbsp; To veil his own
earnestness he turned most naturally to humour, employing it in a spirit
of reverence, as all the great humorists have done, to express his deepest
and most serious convictions.&nbsp; He was aware that he ran the risk
of being misunderstood by some, but he also knew that it is useless
to try to please all, and, like Mozart, he wrote to please himself and
a few intimate friends.</p>
<p>I cannot speak at length of his kindness, consideration, and sympathy;
nor of his generosity, the extent of which was very great and can never
be known&mdash;it was sometimes exercised in unexpected ways, as when
he gave my laundress a shilling because it was &ldquo;such a beastly
foggy morning&rdquo;; nor of his slightly archaic courtliness&mdash;unless
among people he knew well he usually left the room backwards, bowing
to the company; nor of his punctiliousness, industry, and painstaking
attention to detail&mdash;he kept accurate accounts not only of all
his property by double entry but also of his daily expenditure, which
he balanced to a halfpenny every evening, and his handwriting, always
beautiful and legible, was more so at sixty-six than at twenty-six;
nor of his patience and cheerfulness during years of anxiety when he
had few to sympathize with him; nor of the strange mixture of simplicity
and shrewdness that caused one who knew him well to say: &ldquo;II sait
tout; il ne sait rien; il est po&egrave;te.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Epitaphs always fascinated him, and formerly he used to say he should
like to be buried at Langar and to have on his tombstone the subject
of the last of Handel&rsquo;s <i>Six Great Fugues</i>.&nbsp; He called
this &ldquo;The Old Man Fugue,&rdquo; and said it was like an epitaph
composed for himself by one who was very old and tired and sorry for
things; and he made young Ernest Pontifex in <i>The Way of all Flesh</i>
offer it to Edward Overton as an epitaph for his Aunt Alethea.&nbsp;
Butler, however, left off wanting any tombstone long before he died.&nbsp;
In accordance with his wish his body was cremated, and a week later
Alfred and I returned to Woking and buried his ashes under the shrubs
in the garden of the crematorium, with nothing to mark the spot.</p>
<h2>The Humour of Homer <a name="citation59"></a><a href="#footnote59">{59}</a></h2>
<p>The first of the two great poems commonly ascribed to Homer is called
the <i>Iliad</i>&mdash;a title which we may be sure was not given it
by the author.&nbsp; It professes to treat of a quarrel between Agamemnon
and Achilles that broke out while the Greeks were besieging the city
of Troy, and it does, indeed, deal largely with the consequences of
this quarrel; whether, however, the ostensible subject did not conceal
another that was nearer the poet&rsquo;s heart&mdash;I mean the last
days, death, and burial of Hector&mdash;is a point that I cannot determine.&nbsp;
Nor yet can I determine how much of the <i>Iliad</i> as we now have
it is by Homer, and how much by a later writer or writers.&nbsp; This
is a very vexed question, but I myself believe the <i>Iliad</i> to be
entirely by a single poet.</p>
<p>The second poem commonly ascribed to the same author is called the
<i>Odyssey</i>.&nbsp; It deals with the adventures of Ulysses during
his ten years of wandering after Troy had fallen.&nbsp; These two works
have of late years been believed to be by different authors.&nbsp; The
<i>Iliad</i> is now generally held to be the older work by some one
or two hundred years.</p>
<p>The leading ideas of the <i>Iliad</i> are love, war, and plunder,
though this last is less insisted on than the other two.&nbsp; The key-note
is struck with a woman&rsquo;s charms, and a quarrel among men for their
possession.&nbsp; It is a woman who is at the bottom of the Trojan war
itself.&nbsp; Woman throughout the <i>Iliad</i> is a being to be loved,
teased, laughed at, and if necessary carried off.&nbsp; We are told
in one place of a fine bronze cauldron for heating water which was worth
twenty oxen, whereas a few lines lower down a good serviceable maid-of-all-work
is valued at four oxen.&nbsp; I think there is a spice of malicious
humour in this valuation, and am confirmed in this opinion by noting
that though woman in the <i>Iliad</i> is on one occasion depicted as
a wife so faithful and affectionate that nothing more perfect can be
found either in real life or fiction, yet as a general rule she is drawn
as teasing, scolding, thwarting, contradicting, and hoodwinking the
sex that has the effrontery to deem itself her lord and master.&nbsp;
Whether or no this view may have arisen from any domestic difficulties
between Homer and his wife is a point which again I find it impossible
to determine.</p>
<p>We cannot refrain from contemplating such possibilities.&nbsp; If
we are to be at home with Homer there must be no sitting on the edge
of one&rsquo;s chair dazzled by the splendour of his reputation.&nbsp;
He was after all only a literary man, and those who occupy themselves
with letters must approach him as a very honoured member of their own
fraternity, but still as one who must have felt, thought, and acted
much as themselves.&nbsp; He struck oil, while we for the most part
succeed in boring only; still we are his literary brethren, and if we
would read his lines intelligently we must also read between them.&nbsp;
That one so shrewd, and yet a dreamer of such dreams as have been vouchsafed
to few indeed besides himself&mdash;that one so genially sceptical,
and so given to looking into the heart of a matter, should have been
in such perfect harmony with his surroundings as to think himself in
the best of all possible worlds&mdash;this is not believable.&nbsp;
The world is always more or less out of joint to the poet&mdash;generally
more so; and unfortunately he always thinks it more or less his business
to set it right&mdash;generally more so.&nbsp; We are all of us more
or less poets&mdash;generally, indeed, less so; still we feel and think,
and to think at all is to be out of harmony with much that we think
about.&nbsp; We may be sure, then, that Homer had his full share of
troubles, and also that traces of these abound up and down his work
if we could only identify them, for everything that everyone does is
in some measure a portrait of himself; but here comes the difficulty&mdash;not
to read between the lines, not to try and detect the hidden features
of the writer&mdash;this is to be a dull, unsympathetic, incurious reader;
and on the other hand to try and read between them is to be in danger
of running after every Will o&rsquo; the Wisp that conceit may raise
for our delusion.</p>
<p>I believe it will help you better to understand the broad humour
of the <i>Iliad</i>, which we shall presently reach, if you will allow
me to say a little more about the general characteristics of the poem.&nbsp;
Over and above the love and war that are his main themes, there is another
which the author never loses sight of&mdash;I mean distrust and dislike
of the ideas of his time as regards the gods and omens.&nbsp; No poet
ever made gods in his own image more defiantly than the author of the
<i>Iliad</i>.&nbsp; In the likeness of man created he them, and the
only excuse for him is that he obviously desired his readers not to
take them seriously.&nbsp; This at least is the impression he leaves
upon his reader, and when so great a man as Homer leaves an impression
it must be presumed that he does so intentionally.&nbsp; It may be almost
said that he has made the gods take the worse, not the better, side
of man&rsquo;s nature upon them, and to be in all respects as we ourselves&mdash;yet
without virtue.&nbsp; It should be noted, however, that the gods on
the Trojan side are treated far more leniently than those who help the
Greeks.</p>
<p>The chief gods on the Grecian side are Juno, Minerva, and Neptune.&nbsp;
Juno, as you will shortly see, is a scolding wife, who in spite of all
Jove&rsquo;s bluster wears the breeches, or tries exceedingly hard to
do so.&nbsp; Minerva is an angry termagant&mdash;mean, mischief-making,
and vindictive.&nbsp; She begins by pulling Achilles&rsquo; hair, and
later on she knocks the helmet from off the head of Mars.&nbsp; She
hates Venus, and tells the Grecian hero Diomede that he had better not
wound any of the other gods, but that he is to hit Venus if he can,
which he presently does &lsquo;because he sees that she is feeble and
not like Minerva or Bellona.&rsquo;&nbsp; Neptune is a bitter hater.</p>
<p>Apollo, Mars, Venus, Diana, and Jove, so far as his wife will let
him, are on the Trojan side.&nbsp; These, as I have said, meet with
better, though still somewhat contemptuous, treatment at the poet&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; Jove, however, is being mocked and laughed at from first
to last, and if one moral can be drawn from the <i>Iliad</i> more clearly
than another, it is that he is only to be trusted to a very limited
extent.&nbsp; Homer&rsquo;s position, in fact, as regards divine interference
is the very opposite of David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; David writes, &ldquo;Put
not your trust in princes nor in any child of man; there is no sure
help but from the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; With Homer it is, &ldquo;Put not
your trust in Jove neither in any omen from heaven; there is but one
good omen&mdash;to fight for one&rsquo;s country.&nbsp; Fortune favours
the brave; heaven helps those who help themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The god who comes off best is Vulcan, the lame, hobbling, old blacksmith,
who is the laughing-stock of all the others, and whose exquisitely graceful
skilful workmanship forms such an effective contrast to the uncouth
exterior of the workman.&nbsp; Him, as a man of genius and an artist,
and furthermore as a somewhat despised artist, Homer treats, if with
playfulness, still with respect, in spite of the fact that circumstances
have thrown him more on the side of the Greeks than of the Trojans,
with whom I understand Homer&rsquo;s sympathies mainly to lie.</p>
<p>The poet either dislikes music or is at best insensible to it.&nbsp;
Great poets very commonly are so.&nbsp; Achilles, indeed, does on one
occasion sing to his own accompaniment on the lyre, but we are not told
that it was any pleasure to hear him, and Patroclus, who was in the
tent at the time, was not enjoying it; he was only waiting for Achilles
to leave off.&nbsp; But though not fond of music, Homer has a very keen
sense of the beauties of nature, and is constantly referring both in
and out of season to all manner of homely incidents that are as familiar
to us as to himself.&nbsp; Sparks in the train of a shooting-star; a
cloud of dust upon a high road; foresters going out to cut wood in a
forest; the shrill cry of the cicale; children making walls of sand
on the sea-shore, or teasing wasps when they have found a wasps&rsquo;
nest; a poor but very honest woman who gains a pittance for her children
by selling wool, and weighs it very carefully; a child clinging to its
mother&rsquo;s dress and crying to be taken up and carried&mdash;none
of these things escape him.&nbsp; Neither in the <i>Iliad</i> nor the
<i>Odyssey</i> do we ever receive so much as a hint as to the time of
year at which any of the events described are happening; but on one
occasion the author of the <i>Iliad</i> really has told us that it was
a very fine day, and this not from a business point of view, but out
of pure regard to the weather for its own sake.</p>
<p>With one more observation I will conclude my preliminary remarks
about the <i>Iliad</i>.&nbsp; I cannot find its author within the four
corners of the work itself.&nbsp; I believe the writer of the <i>Odyssey</i>
to appear in the poem as a prominent and very fascinating character
whom we shall presently meet, but there is no one in the <i>Iliad</i>
on whom I can put my finger with even a passing idea that he may be
the author.&nbsp; Still, if under some severe penalty I were compelled
to find him, I should say it was just possible that he might consider
his own lot to have been more or less like that which he forecasts for
Astyanax, the infant son of Hector.&nbsp; At any rate his intimate acquaintance
with the topography of Troy, which is now well ascertained, and still
more his obvious attempt to excuse the non-existence of a great wall
which, according to his story, ought to be there and which he knew had
never existed, so that no trace could remain, while there were abundant
traces of all the other features he describes&mdash;these facts convince
me that he was in all probability a native of the Troad, or country
round Troy.&nbsp; His plausibly concealed Trojan sympathies, and more
particularly the aggravated exaggeration with which the flight of Hector
is described, suggest to me, coming as they do from an astute and humorous
writer, that he may have been a Trojan, at any rate by the mother&rsquo;s
side, made captive, enslaved, compelled to sing the glories of his captors,
and determined so to overdo them that if his masters cannot see through
the irony others sooner or later shall.&nbsp; This, however, is highly
speculative, and there are other views that are perhaps more true, but
which I cannot now consider.</p>
<p>I will now ask you to form your own opinions as to whether Homer
is or is not a shrewd and humorous writer.</p>
<p>Achilles, whose quarrel with Agamemnon is the ostensible subject
of the poem, is son to a marine goddess named Thetis, who had rendered
Jove an important service at a time when he was in great difficulties.&nbsp;
Achilles, therefore, begs his mother Thetis to go up to Jove and ask
him to let the Trojans discomfit the Greeks for a time, so that Agamemnon
may find he cannot get on without Achilles&rsquo; help, and may thus
be brought to reason.</p>
<p>Thetis tells her son that for the moment there is nothing to be done,
inasmuch as the gods are all of them away from home.&nbsp; They are
gone to pay a visit to Oceanus in Central Africa, and will not be back
for another ten or twelve days; she will see what can be done, however,
as soon as ever they return.&nbsp; This in due course she does, going
up to Olympus and laying hold of Jove by the knee and by the chin.&nbsp;
I may say in passing that it is still a common Italian form of salutation
to catch people by the chin.&nbsp; Twice during the last summer I have
been so seized in token of affectionate greeting, once by a lady and
once by a gentleman.</p>
<p>Thetis tells her tale to Jove, and concludes by saying that he is
to say straight out &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; whether he
will do what she asks.&nbsp; Of course he can please himself, but she
should like to know how she stands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a plaguy business,&rdquo; answers Jove, &ldquo;for
me to offend Juno and put up with all the bitter tongue she will give
me.&nbsp; As it is, she is always nagging at me and saying I help the
Trojans, still, go away now at once before she finds out that you have
been here, and leave the rest to me.&nbsp; See, I nod my head to you,
and this is the most solemn form of covenant into which I can enter.&nbsp;
I never go back upon it, nor shilly-shally with anybody when I have
once nodded my head.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which, by the way, amounts to an admission
that he does shilly-shally sometimes.</p>
<p>Then he frowns and nods, shaking the hair on his immortal head till
Olympus rocks again.&nbsp; Thetis goes off under the sea and Jove returns
to his own palace.&nbsp; All the other gods stand up when they see him
coming, for they do not dare to remain sitting while he passes, but
Juno knows he has been hatching mischief against the Greeks with Thetis,
so she attacks him in the following words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You traitorous scoundrel,&rdquo; she exclaims, &ldquo;which
of the gods have you been taking into your counsel now?&nbsp; You are
always trying to settle matters behind my back, and never tell me, if
you can help it, a single word about your designs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Juno,&rsquo; replied the father of gods and men, &lsquo;you
must not expect to be told everything that I am thinking about: you
are my wife, it is true, but you might not be able always to understand
my meaning; in so far as it is proper for you to know of my intentions
you are the first person to whom I communicate them either among the
gods or among mankind, but there are certain points which I reserve
entirely for myself, and the less you try to pry into these, or meddle
with them, the better for you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dread son of Saturn,&rsquo; answered Juno, &lsquo;what
in the world are you talking about?&nbsp; I meddle and pry?&nbsp; No
one, I am sure, can have his own way in everything more absolutely than
you have.&nbsp; Still I have a strong misgiving that the old merman&rsquo;s
daughter Thetis has been talking you over.&nbsp; I saw her hugging your
knees this very self-same morning, and I suspect you have been promising
her to kill any number of people down at the Grecian ships, in order
to gratify Achilles.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wife,&rsquo; replied Jove, &lsquo;I can do nothing
but you suspect me.&nbsp; You will not do yourself any good, for the
more you go on like that the more I dislike you, and it may fare badly
with you.&nbsp; If I mean to have it so, I mean to have it so, you had
better therefore sit still and hold your tongue as I tell you, for if
I once begin to lay my hands about you, there is not a god in heaven
who will be of the smallest use to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Juno heard this she thought it better to submit, so she
sat down without a word, but all the gods throughout Jove&rsquo;s mansion
were very much perturbed.&nbsp; Presently the cunning workman Vulcan
tried to pacify his mother Juno, and said, &lsquo;It will never do for
you two to go on quarrelling and setting heaven in an uproar about a
pack of mortals.&nbsp; The thing will not bear talking about.&nbsp;
If such counsels are to prevail a god will not be able to get his dinner
in peace.&nbsp; Let me then advise my mother (and I am sure it is her
own opinion) to make her peace with my dear father, lest he should scold
her still further, and spoil our banquet; for if he does wish to turn
us all out there can be no question about his being perfectly able to
do so.&nbsp; Say something civil to him, therefore, and then perhaps
he will not hurt us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he spoke he took a large cup of nectar and put it into
his mother&rsquo;s hands, saying, &lsquo;Bear it, my dear mother, and
make the best of it.&nbsp; I love you dearly and should be very sorry
to see you get a thrashing.&nbsp; I should not be able to help you,
for my father Jove is not a safe person to differ from.&nbsp; You know
once before when I was trying to help you he caught me by the foot and
chucked me from the heavenly threshold.&nbsp; I was all day long falling
from morn to eve, but at sunset I came to ground on the island of Lemnos,
and there was very little life left in me, till the Sintians came and
tended me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this Juno smiled, and with a laugh took the cup from her
son&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Then Vulcan went about among all other gods
drawing nectar for them from his goblet, and they laughed immoderately
as they saw him bustling about the heavenly mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then presently the gods go home to bed, each one in his own house
that Vulcan had cunningly built for him or her.&nbsp; Finally Jove himself
went to the bed which he generally occupied; and Jove his wife went
with him.</p>
<p>There is another quarrel between Jove and Juno at the beginning of
the fourth book.</p>
<p>The gods are sitting on the golden floor of Jove&rsquo;s palace and
drinking one another&rsquo;s health in the nectar with which Hebe from
time to time supplies them.&nbsp; Jove begins to tease Juno, and to
provoke her with some sarcastic remarks that are pointed at her though
not addressed to her directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Menelaus,&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;has two good
friends among the goddesses, Juno and Minerva, but they only sit still
and look on, while Venus on the other hand takes much better care of
Paris, and defends him when he is in danger.&nbsp; She has only just
this moment been rescuing him when he made sure he was at death&rsquo;s
door, for the victory really did lie with Menelaus.&nbsp; We must think
what we are to do about all this.&nbsp; Shall we renew strife between
the combatants or shall we make them friends again?&nbsp; I think the
best plan would be for the City of Priam to remain unpillaged, but for
Menelaus to have his wife Helen sent back to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minerva and Juno groaned in spirit when they heard this.&nbsp;
They were sitting side by side, and thinking what mischief they could
do to the Trojans.&nbsp; Minerva for her part said not one word, but
sat scowling at her father, for she was in a furious passion with him,
but Juno could not contain herself, so she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What, pray, son of Saturn, is all this about?&nbsp;
Is my trouble then to go for nothing, and all the pains that I have
taken, to say nothing of my horses, and the way we have sweated and
toiled to get the people together against Priam and his children?&nbsp;
You can do as you please, but you must not expect all of us to agree
with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jove answered, &lsquo;Wife, what harm have Priam and Priam&rsquo;s
children done you that you rage so furiously against them, and want
to sack their city?&nbsp; Will nothing do for you but you must eat Priam
with his sons and all the Trojans into the bargain?&nbsp; Have it your
own way then, for I will not quarrel with you&mdash;only remember what
I tell you: if at any time I want to sack a city that belongs to any
friend of yours, it will be no use your trying to hinder me, you will
have to let me do it, for I only yield to you now with the greatest
reluctance.&nbsp; If there was one city under the sun which I respected
more than another it was Troy with its king and people.&nbsp; My altars
there have never been without the savour of fat or of burnt sacrifice
and all my dues were paid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My own favourite cities,&rsquo; answered Juno, &lsquo;are
Argos, Sparta, and Mycen&aelig;.&nbsp; Sack them whenever you may be
displeased with them.&nbsp; I shall not make the smallest protest against
your doing so.&nbsp; It would be no use if I did, for you are much stronger
than I am, only I will not submit to seeing my own work wasted.&nbsp;
I am a goddess of the same race as yourself.&nbsp; I am Saturn&rsquo;s
eldest daughter and am not only nearly related to you in blood, but
I am wife to yourself, and you are king over the gods.&nbsp; Let it
be a case, then, of give and take between us, and the other gods will
follow our lead.&nbsp; Tell Minerva, therefore, to go down at once and
set the Greeks and Trojans by the ears again, and let her so manage
it that the Trojans shall break their oaths and be the aggressors.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the very thing to suit Minerva, so she goes at once and persuades
the Trojans to break their oath.</p>
<p>In a later book we are told that Jove has positively forbidden the
gods to interfere further in the struggle.&nbsp; Juno therefore determines
to hoodwink him.&nbsp; First she bolted herself inside her own room
on the top of Mount Ida and had a thorough good wash.&nbsp; Then she
scented herself, brushed her golden hair, put on her very best dress
and all her jewels.&nbsp; When she had done this, she went to Venus
and besought her for the loan of her charms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must not be angry with me, Venus,&rsquo; she began,
&lsquo;for being on the Grecian side while you are yourself on the Trojan;
but you know every one falls in love with you at once, and I want you
to lend me some of your attractions.&nbsp; I have to pay a visit at
the world&rsquo;s end to Oceanus and Mother Tethys.&nbsp; They took
me in and were very good to me when Jove turned Saturn out of heaven
and shut him up under the sea.&nbsp; They have been quarrelling this
long time past and will not speak to one another.&nbsp; So I must go
and see them, for if I can only make them friends again I am sure that
they will be grateful to me for ever afterwards.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Venus thought this reasonable, so she took off her girdle and lent
it to Juno, an act by the way which argues more good nature than prudence
on her part.&nbsp; Then Juno goes down to Thrace, and in search of Sleep
the brother of Death.&nbsp; She finds him and shakes hands with him.&nbsp;
Then she tells him she is going up to Olympus to make love to Jove,
and that while she is occupying his attention Sleep is to send him off
into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>Sleep says he dares not do it.&nbsp; He would lull any of the other
gods, but Juno must remember that she had got him into a great scrape
once before in this way, and Jove hurled the gods about all over the
palace, and would have made an end of him once for all, if he had not
fled under the protection of Night, whom Jove did not venture to offend.</p>
<p>Juno bribes him, however, with a promise that if he will consent
she will marry him to the youngest of the Graces, Pasithea.&nbsp; On
this he yields; the pair then go up to the top of Mount Ida, and Sleep
gets into a high pine tree just in front of Jove.</p>
<p>As soon as Jove sees Juno, armed as she for the moment was with all
the attractions of Venus, he falls desperately in love with her, and
says she is the only goddess he ever really loved.&nbsp; True, there
had been the wife of Ixion and Danae, and Europa and Semele, and Alcmena,
and Latona, not to mention herself in days gone by, but he never loved
any of these as he now loved her, in spite of his having been married
to her for so many years.&nbsp; What then does she want?</p>
<p>Juno tells him the same rigmarole about Oceanus and Mother Tethys
that she had told Venus, and when she has done Jove tries to embrace
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; exclaims Juno, &ldquo;kiss me in such a public
place as the top of Mount Ida!&nbsp; Impossible!&nbsp; I could never
show my face in Olympus again, but I have a private room of my own and&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What
nonsense, my love!&rdquo; exclaims the sire of gods and men as he catches
her in his arms.&nbsp; On this Sleep sends him into a deep slumber,
and Juno then sends Sleep to bid Neptune go off to help the Greeks at
once.</p>
<p>When Jove awakes and finds the trick that has been played upon him,
he is very angry and blusters a good deal as usual, but somehow or another
it turns out that he has got to stand it and make the best of it.</p>
<p>In an earlier book he has said that he is not surprised at anything
Juno may do, for she always has crossed him and always will; but he
cannot put up with such disobedience from his own daughter Minerva.&nbsp;
Somehow or another, however, here too as usual it turns out that he
has got to stand it.&nbsp; &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; Minerva exclaims
in yet another place (VIII. 373), &ldquo;I suppose he will be calling
me his grey-eyed darling again, presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards the end of the poem the gods have a set-to among themselves.&nbsp;
Minerva sends Mars sprawling, Venus comes to his assistance, but Minerva
knocks her down and leaves her.&nbsp; Neptune challenges Apollo, but
Apollo says it is not proper for a god to fight his own uncle, and declines
the contest.&nbsp; His sister Diana taunts him with cowardice, so Juno
grips her by the wrist and boxes her ears till she writhes again.&nbsp;
Latona, the mother of Apollo and Diana, then challenges Mercury, but
Mercury says that he is not going to fight with any of Jove&rsquo;s
wives, so if she chooses to say she has beaten him she is welcome to
do so.&nbsp; Then Latona picks up poor Diana&rsquo;s bow and arrows
that have fallen from her during her encounter with Juno, and Diana
meanwhile flies up to the knees of her father Jove, sobbing and sighing
till her ambrosial robe trembles all around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jove drew her towards him, and smiling pleasantly exclaimed,
&lsquo;My dear child, which of the heavenly beings has been wicked enough
to behave in this way to you, as though you had been doing something
naughty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your wife, Juno,&rsquo; answered Diana, &lsquo;has
been ill-treating me; all our quarrels always begin with her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The above extracts must suffice as examples of the kind of divine
comedy in which Homer brings the gods and goddesses upon the scene.&nbsp;
Among mortals the humour, what there is of it, is confined mainly to
the grim taunts which the heroes fling at one another when they are
fighting, and more especially to crowing over a fallen foe.&nbsp; The
most subtle passage is the one in which Briseis, the captive woman about
whom Achilles and Agamemnon have quarrelled, is restored by Agamemnon
to Achilles.&nbsp; Briseis on her return to the tent of Achilles finds
that while she has been with Agamemnon, Patroclus has been killed by
Hector, and his dead body is now lying in state.&nbsp; She flings herself
upon the corpse and exclaims&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How one misfortune does keep falling upon me after another!&nbsp;
I saw the man to whom my father and mother had married me killed before
my eyes, and my three own dear brothers perished along with him; but
you, Patroclus, even when Achilles was sacking our city and killing
my husband, told me that I was not to cry; for you said that Achilles
himself should marry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, where
we should have a wedding feast among the Myrmidons.&nbsp; You were always
kind to me, and I should never cease to grieve for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This may of course be seriously intended, but Homer was an acute
writer, and if we had met with such a passage in Thackeray we should
have taken him to mean that so long as a woman can get a new husband,
she does not much care about losing the old one&mdash;a sentiment which
I hope no one will imagine that I for one moment endorse or approve
of, and which I can only explain as a piece of sarcasm aimed possibly
at Mrs. Homer.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>And now let us turn to the <i>Odyssey</i>, a work which I myself
think of as the <i>Iliad&rsquo;s</i> better half or wife.&nbsp; Here
we have a poem of more varied interest, instinct with not less genius,
and on the whole I should say, if less robust, nevertheless of still
greater fascination&mdash;one, moreover, the irony of which is pointed
neither at gods nor woman, but with one single and perhaps intercalated
exception, at man.&nbsp; Gods and women may sometimes do wrong things,
but, except as regards the intrigue between Mars and Venus just referred
to, they are never laughed at.&nbsp; The scepticism of the <i>Iliad</i>
is that of Hume or Gibbon; that of the <i>Odyssey</i> (if any) is like
the occasional mild irreverence of the Vicar&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp;
When Jove says he will do a thing, there is no uncertainty about his
doing it.&nbsp; Juno hardly appears at all, and when she does she never
quarrels with her husband.&nbsp; Minerva has more to do than any of
the other gods or goddesses, but she has nothing in common with the
Minerva whom we have already seen in the <i>Iliad</i>.&nbsp; In the
<i>Odyssey</i> she is the fairy god-mother who seems to have no object
in life but to protect Ulysses and Telemachus, and keep them straight
at any touch and turn of difficulty.&nbsp; If she has any other function,
it is to be patroness of the arts and of all intellectual development.&nbsp;
The Minerva of the <i>Odyssey</i> may indeed sit on a rafter like a
swallow and hold up her &aelig;gis to strike panic into the suitors
while Ulysses kills them; but she is a perfect lady, and would no more
knock Mars and Venus down one after the other than she would stand on
her head.&nbsp; She is, in fact, a distinct person in all respects from
the Minerva of the <i>Iliad</i>.&nbsp; Of the remaining gods Neptune,
as the persecutor of the hero, comes worst off; but even he is treated
as though he were a very important person.</p>
<p>In the <i>Odyssey</i> the gods no longer live in houses and sleep
in four-post bedsteads, but the conception of their abode, like that
of their existence altogether, is far more spiritual.&nbsp; Nobody knows
exactly where they live, but they say it is in Olympus, where there
is neither rain nor hail nor snow, and the wind never beats roughly;
but it abides in everlasting sunshine, and in great peacefulness of
light wherein the blessed gods are illumined for ever and ever.&nbsp;
It is hardly possible to conceive anything more different from the Olympus
of the <i>Iliad.</i></p>
<p>Another very material point of difference between the <i>Iliad</i>
and the <i>Odyssey</i> lies in the fact that the Homer of the <i>Iliad</i>
always knows what he is talking about, while the supposed Homer of the
<i>Odyssey</i> often makes mistakes that betray an almost incredible
ignorance of detail.&nbsp; Thus the giant Polyphemus drives in his ewes
home from their pasture, and milks them.&nbsp; The lambs of course have
not been running with them; they have been left in the yards, so they
have had nothing to eat.&nbsp; When he has milked the ewes, the giant
lets each one of them have her lamb&mdash;to get, I suppose, what strippings
it can, and beyond this what milk the ewe may yield during the night.&nbsp;
In the morning, however, Polyphemus milks the ewes again.&nbsp; Hence
it is plain either that he expected his lambs to thrive on one pull
<i>per diem</i> at a milked ewe, and to be kind enough not to suck their
mothers, though left with them all night through, or else that the writer
of the <i>Odyssey</i> had very hazy notions about the relations between
lambs and ewes, and of the ordinary methods of procedure on an upland
dairy-farm.</p>
<p>In nautical matters the same inexperience is betrayed.&nbsp; The
writer knows all about the corn and wine that must be put on board;
the store-room in which these are kept and the getting of them are described
inimitably, but there the knowledge ends; the other things put on board
are &ldquo;the things that are generally taken on board ships.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So on a voyage we are told that the sailors do whatever is wanted doing,
but we have no details.&nbsp; There is a shipwreck, which does duty
more than once without the alteration of a word.&nbsp; I have seen such
a shipwreck at Drury Lane.&nbsp; Anyone, moreover, who reads any authentic
account of actual adventures will perceive at once that those of the
<i>Odyssey</i> are the creation of one who has had no history.&nbsp;
Ulysses has to make a raft; he makes it about as broad as they generally
make a good big ship, but we do not seem to have been at the pains to
measure a good big ship.</p>
<p>I will add no more however on this head.&nbsp; The leading characteristics
of the <i>Iliad</i>, as we saw, were love, war, and plunder.&nbsp; The
leading idea of the <i>Odyssey</i> is the infatuation of man, and the
key-note is struck in the opening paragraph, where we are told how the
sailors of Ulysses must needs, in spite of every warning, kill and eat
the cattle of the sun-god, and perished accordingly.</p>
<p>A few lines lower down the same note is struck with even greater
emphasis.&nbsp; The gods have met in council, and Jove happens at the
moment to be thinking of &AElig;gisthus, who had met his death at the
hand of Agamemnon&rsquo;s son Orestes, in spite of the solemn warning
that Jove had sent him through the mouth of Mercury.&nbsp; It does not
seem necessary for Jove to turn his attention to Clytemnestra, the partner
of &AElig;gisthus&rsquo;s guilt.&nbsp; Of this lady we are presently
told that she was naturally of an excellent disposition, and would never
have gone wrong but for the loss of the protector in whose charge Agamemnon
had left her.&nbsp; When she was left alone without an adviser&mdash;well,
if a base designing man took to flattering and misleading her&mdash;what
else could be expected?&nbsp; The infatuation of man, with its corollary,
the superior excellence of woman, is the leading theme; next to this
come art, religion, and, I am almost ashamed to add, money.&nbsp; There
is no love-business in the <i>Odyssey</i> except the return of a bald
elderly married man to his elderly wife and grown-up son after an absence
of twenty years, and furious at having been robbed of so much money
in the meantime.&nbsp; But this can hardly be called love-business;
it is at the utmost domesticity.&nbsp; There is a charming young princess,
Nausicaa, but though she affects a passing tenderness for the elderly
hero of her creation as soon as Minerva has curled his bald old hair
for him and tittivated him up all over, she makes it abundantly plain
that she will not look at a single one of her actual flesh and blood
admirers.&nbsp; There is a leading young gentleman, Telemachus, who
is nothing if he is not &pi;&epsilon;&pi;&nu;&upsilon;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
or canny, well-principled, and discreet; he has an amiable and most
sensible young male friend who says that he does not like crying at
meal times&mdash;he will cry in the forenoon on an empty stomach as
much as anyone pleases, but he cannot attend properly to his dinner
and cry at the same time.&nbsp; Well, there is no lady provided either
for this nice young man or for Telemachus.&nbsp; They are left high
and dry as bachelors.&nbsp; Two goddesses indeed, Circe and Calypso,
do one after the other take possession of Ulysses, but the way in which
he accepts a situation which after all was none of his seeking, and
which it is plain he does not care two straws about, is, I believe,
dictated solely by a desire to exhibit the easy infidelity of Ulysses
himself in contrast with the unswerving constancy and fidelity of his
wife Penelope.&nbsp; Throughout the <i>Odyssey</i> the men do not really
care for women, nor the women for men; they have to pretend to do so
now and again, but it is a got-up thing, and the general attitude of
the sexes towards one another is very much that of Helen, who says that
her husband Menelaus is really not deficient in person or understanding:
or again of Penelope herself, who, on being asked by Ulysses on his
return what she thought of him, said that she did not think very much
of him nor very little of him; in fact, she did not think much about
him one way or the other.&nbsp; True, later on she relents and becomes
more effusive; in fact, when she and Ulysses sat up talking in bed and
Ulysses told her the story of his adventures, she never went to sleep
once.&nbsp; Ulysses never had to nudge her with his elbow and say, &ldquo;Come,
wake up, Penelope, you are not listening&rdquo;; but, in spite of the
devotion exhibited here, the love-business in the <i>Odyssey</i> is
artificial and described by one who had never felt it, whereas in the
<i>Iliad</i> it is spontaneous and obviously genuine, as by one who
knows all about it perfectly well.&nbsp; The love-business in fact of
the <i>Odyssey</i> is turned on as we turn on the gas&mdash;when we
cannot get on without it, but not otherwise.</p>
<p>A fascinating brilliant girl, who naturally adopts for her patroness
the blue-stocking Minerva; a man-hatress, as clever girls so often are,
and determined to pay the author of the <i>Iliad</i> out for his treatment
of her sex by insisting on its superior moral, not to say intellectual,
capacity, and on the self-sufficient imbecility of man unless he has
a woman always at his elbow to keep him tolerably straight and in his
proper place&mdash;this, and not the musty fusty old bust we see in
libraries, is the kind of person who I believe wrote the <i>Odyssey</i>.&nbsp;
Of course in reality the work must be written by a man, because they
say so at Oxford and Cambridge, and they know everything down in Oxford
and Cambridge; but I venture to say that if the <i>Odyssey</i> were
to appear anonymously for the first time now, and to be sent round to
the papers for review, there is not even a professional critic who would
not see that it is a woman&rsquo;s writing and not a man&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
But letting this pass, I can hardly doubt, for reasons which I gave
in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, and for others that I cannot
now insist upon, that the poem was written by a native of Trapani on
the coast of Sicily, near Marsala.&nbsp; Fancy what the position of
a young, ardent, brilliant woman must have been in a small Sicilian
sea-port, say some eight or nine hundred years before the birth of Christ.&nbsp;
It makes one shudder to think of it.&nbsp; Night after night she hears
the dreary blind old bard Demodocus drawl out his interminable recitals
taken from our present <i>Iliad</i>, or from some other of the many
poems now lost that dealt with the adventures of the Greeks before Troy
or on their homeward journey.&nbsp; Man and his doings! always the same
old story, and woman always to be treated either as a toy or as a beast
of burden, or at any rate as an incubus.&nbsp; Why not sing of woman
also as she is when she is unattached and free from the trammels and
persecutions of this tiresome tyrant, this insufferably self-conceited
bore and booby, man?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish, my dear,&rdquo; exclaims her mother Arete, after one
of these little outbreaks, &ldquo;that you would do it yourself.&nbsp;
I am sure you could do it beautifully if you would only give your mind
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, mother,&rdquo; she replies, &ldquo;and I will bring
in all about you and father, and how I go out for a washing-day with
the maids,&rdquo;&mdash;and she kept her word, as I will presently show
you.</p>
<p>I should tell you that Ulysses, having got away from the goddess
Calypso, with whom he had been living for some seven or eight years
on a lonely and very distant island in mid-ocean, is shipwrecked on
the coast of Ph&aelig;acia, the chief town of which is Scheria.&nbsp;
After swimming some forty-eight hours in the water he effects a landing
at the mouth of a stream, and, not having a rag of clothes on his back,
covers himself up under a heap of dried leaves and goes to sleep.&nbsp;
I will now translate from the <i>Odyssey</i> itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here Ulysses slept, worn out with labour and sorrow; but
Minerva went off to the chief town of the Ph&aelig;acians, a people
who used to live in Hypereia near the wicked Cyclopes.&nbsp; Now the
Cyclopes were stronger than they and plundered them, so Nausithous settled
them in Scheria far from those who would loot them.&nbsp; He ran a wall
round about the city, built houses and temples, and allotted the lands
among his people; but he was gathered to his fathers, and the good king
Alcinous was now reigning.&nbsp; To his palace then Minerva hastened
that she might help Ulysses to get home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went straight to the painted bedroom of Nausicaa, who
was daughter to King Alcinous, and lovely as a goddess.&nbsp; Near her
there slept two maids-in-waiting, both very pretty, one on either side
of the doorway, which was closed with a beautifully made door.&nbsp;
She took the form of the famous Captain Dumas&rsquo;s daughter, who
was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age; then coming into
the room like a breath of wind she stood near the head of the bed and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nausicaa, what could your mother have been about to
have such a lazy daughter?&nbsp; Here are your clothes all lying in
disorder, yet you are going to be married almost directly, and should
not only be well-dressed yourself, but should see that those about you
look clean and tidy also.&nbsp; This is the way to make people speak
well of you, and it will please your father and mother, so suppose we
make to-morrow a washing day, and begin the first thing in the morning.&nbsp;
I will come and help you, for all the best young men among your own
people are courting you, and you are not going to remain a maid much
longer.&nbsp; Ask your father, then, to have a horse and cart ready
for us at daybreak to take the linen and baskets, and you can ride too,
which will be much pleasanter for you than walking, for the washing
ground is a long way out of the town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she had thus spoken Minerva went back to Olympus.&nbsp;
By and by morning came, and as soon as Nausicaa woke she began thinking
about her dream.&nbsp; She went to the other end of the house to tell
her father and mother all about it, and found them in their own room.&nbsp;
Her mother was sitting by the fireside spinning with her maids-in-waiting
all around her, and she happened to catch her father just as he was
going out to attend a meeting of the Town Council which the Ph&aelig;acian
aldermen had convened.&nbsp; So she stopped him and said, &lsquo;Papa,
dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon?&nbsp; I want
to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them.&nbsp; You
are the chief man here, so you ought to have a clean shirt on when you
attend meetings of the Council.&nbsp; Moreover, you have five sons at
home, two of them married and the other three are good-looking young
bachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen when they go
out to a dance, and I have been thinking about all this.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will observe that though Nausicaa dreams that she is going to
be married shortly, and that all the best young men of Scheria are in
love with her, she does not dream that she has fallen in love with any
one of them in particular, and that thus every preparation is made for
her getting married except the selection of the bridegroom.</p>
<p>You will also note that Nausicaa has to keep her father up to putting
a clean shirt on when he ought to have one, whereas her young brothers
appear to keep herself up to having a clean shirt ready for them when
they want one.&nbsp; These little touches are so lifelike and so feminine
that they suggest drawing from life by a female member of Alcinous&rsquo;s
own family who knew his character from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I would also say before proceeding further that in some parts of
France and Germany it is still the custom to have but one or at most
two great washing days in the year.&nbsp; Each household is provided
with an enormous quantity of linen, which when dirty is just soaked
and rinsed, and then put aside till the great washing day of the year.&nbsp;
This is why Nausicaa wants a waggon, and has to go so far afield.&nbsp;
If it was only a few collars and a pocket-handkerchief or two she could
no doubt have found water enough near at hand.&nbsp; The big spring
or autumn wash, however, is evidently intended.</p>
<p>Returning now to the <i>Odyssey</i>, when he had heard what Nausicaa
wanted Alcinous said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You shall have the mules, my love, and whatever else
you have a mind for, so be off with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he told the servants, and they got the waggon out and
harnessed the mules, while the princess brought the clothes down from
the linen room and placed them on the waggon.&nbsp; Her mother got ready
a nice basket of provisions with all sorts of good things, and a goatskin
full of wine.&nbsp; The princess now got into the waggon, and her mother
gave her a golden cruse of oil that she and her maids might anoint themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Nausicaa took the whip and reins and gave the mules a
touch which sent them off at a good pace.&nbsp; They pulled without
nagging, and carried not only Nausicaa and her wash of clothes, but
the women also who were with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they got to the river they went to the washing pools,
through which even in summer there ran enough pure water to wash any
quantity of linen, no matter how dirty.&nbsp; Here they unharnessed
the mules and turned them out to feed in the sweet juicy grass that
grew by the river-side.&nbsp; They got the clothes out of the waggon,
brought them to the water, and vied with one another in treading upon
them and banging them about to get the dirt out of them.&nbsp; When
they had got them quite clean, they laid them out by the seaside where
the waves had raised a high beach of shingle, and set about washing
and anointing themselves with olive oil.&nbsp; Then they got their dinner
by the side of the river, and waited for the sun to finish drying the
clothes.&nbsp; By and by, after dinner, they took off their head-dresses
and began to play at ball, and Nausicaa sang to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think you will agree with me that there is no haziness&mdash;no
milking of ewes that have had a lamb with them all night&mdash;here.&nbsp;
The writer is at home and on her own ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they had done folding the clothes and were putting the
mules to the waggon before starting home again, Minerva thought it was
time Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to take
him to the city of the Ph&aelig;acians.&nbsp; So the princess threw
a ball at one of the maids, which missed the maid and fell into the
water.&nbsp; On this they all shouted, and the noise they made woke
up Ulysses, who sat up in his bed of leaves and wondered where in the
world he could have got to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he crept from under the bush beneath which he had slept,
broke off a thick bough so as to cover his nakedness, and advanced towards
Nausicaa and her maids; these last all ran away, but Nausicaa stood
her ground, for Minerva had put courage into her heart, so she kept
quite still, and Ulysses could not make up his mind whether it would
be better to go up to her, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her
knees as a suppliant&mdash;[in which case, of course, he would have
to drop the bough] or whether it would be better for him to make an
apology to her at a reasonable distance, and ask her to be good enough
to give him some clothes and show him the way to the town.&nbsp; On
the whole he thought it would be better to keep at arm&rsquo;s length,
in case the princess should take offence at his coming too near her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let me say in passing that this is one of many passages which have
led me to conclude that the <i>Odyssey</i> is written by a woman.&nbsp;
A girl, such as Nausicaa describes herself, young, unmarried, unattached,
and hence, after all, knowing little of what men feel on these matters,
having by a cruel freak of inspiration got her hero into such an awkward
predicament, might conceivably imagine that he would argue as she represents
him, but no man, except such a woman&rsquo;s tailor as could never have
written such a masterpiece as the <i>Odyssey</i>, would ever get his
hero into such an undignified scrape at all, much less represent him
as arguing as Ulysses does.&nbsp; I suppose Minerva was so busy making
Nausicaa brave that she had no time to put a little sense into Ulysses&rsquo;
head, and remind him that he was nothing if not full of sagacity and
resource.&nbsp; To return&mdash;</p>
<p>Ulysses now begins with the most judicious apology that his unaided
imagination can suggest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your ladyship&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo;
he exclaims, &ldquo;but are you goddess or are you a mortal woman?&nbsp;
If you are a goddess and live in heaven, there can be no doubt but you
are Jove&rsquo;s daughter Diana, for your face and figure are exactly
like hers,&rdquo; and so on in a long speech which I need not further
quote from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; replied Nausicaa, as soon as the speech was
ended, &ldquo;you seem to be a very sensible well-disposed person.&nbsp;
There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives good or ill to every man,
just as he chooses, so you must take your lot, and make the best of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; She then tells him she will give him clothes and everything
else that a foreigner in distress can reasonably expect.&nbsp; She calls
back her maids, scolds them for running away, and tells them to take
Ulysses and wash him in the river after giving him something to eat
and drink.&nbsp; So the maids give him the little gold cruse of oil
and tell him to go and wash himself, and as they seem to have completely
recovered from their alarm, Ulysses is compelled to say, &ldquo;Young
ladies, please stand a little on one side, that I may wash the brine
from off my shoulders and anoint myself with oil; for it is long enough
since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it.&nbsp; I cannot wash as
long as you keep standing there.&nbsp; I have no clothes on, and it
makes me very uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they stood aside and went and told Nausicaa.&nbsp; Meanwhile (I
am translating closely), &ldquo;Minerva made him look taller and stronger
than before; she gave him some more hair on the top of his head, and
made it flow down in curls most beautifully; in fact she glorified him
about the head and shoulders as a cunning workman who has studied under
Vulcan or Minerva enriches a fine piece of plate by gilding it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I argue that I am reading a description of as it were a prehistoric
Mr. Knightley by a not less prehistoric Jane Austen&mdash;with this
difference that I believe Nausicaa is quietly laughing at her hero and
sees through him, whereas Jane Austen takes Mr. Knightley seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, my pretty maids,&rdquo; exclaimed Nausicaa as soon as
she saw Ulysses coming back with his hair curled, &ldquo;hush, for I
want to say something.&nbsp; I believe the gods in heaven have sent
this man here.&nbsp; There is something very remarkable about him.&nbsp;
When I first saw him I thought him quite plain and commonplace, and
now I consider him one of the handsomest men I ever saw in my life.&nbsp;
I should like my future husband [who, it is plain, then, is not yet
decided upon] to be just such another as he is, if he would only stay
here, and not want to go away.&nbsp; However, give him something to
eat and drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nausicaa now says they must be starting homeward; so she tells Ulysses
that she will drive on first herself, but that he is to follow after
her with the maids.&nbsp; She does not want to be seen coming into the
town with him; and then follows another passage which clearly shows
that for all the talk she has made about getting married she has no
present intention of changing her name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;of the gossip
and scandal which may be set on foot about me behind my back, for there
are some very ill-natured people in the town, and some low fellow, if
he met us, might say, &lsquo;Who is this fine-looking stranger who is
going about with Nausicaa?&nbsp; Where did she pick him up?&nbsp; I
suppose she is going to marry him, or perhaps he is some shipwrecked
sailor from foreign parts; or has some god come down from heaven in
answer to her prayers, and she is going to live with him?&nbsp; It would
be a good thing if she would take herself off and find a husband somewhere
else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent young Ph&aelig;acians
who are in love with her&rsquo;; and I could not complain, for I should
myself think ill of any girl whom I saw going about with men unknown
to her father and mother, and without having been married to him in
the face of all the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This passage could never have been written by the local bard, who
was in great measure dependent on Nausicaa&rsquo;s family; he would
never speak thus of his patron&rsquo;s daughter; either the passage
is Nausicaa&rsquo;s apology for herself, written by herself, or it is
pure invention, and this last, considering the close adherence to the
actual topography of Trapani on the Sicilian Coast, and a great deal
else that I cannot lay before you here, appears to me improbable.</p>
<p>Nausicaa then gives Ulysses directions by which he can find her father&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you have got past the courtyard,&rdquo; she
says, &ldquo;go straight through the main hall, till you come to my
mother&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; You will find her sitting by the fire and
spinning her purple wool by firelight.&nbsp; She will make a lovely
picture as she leans back against a column with her maids ranged behind
her.&nbsp; Facing her stands my father&rsquo;s seat in which he sits
and topes like an immortal god.&nbsp; Never mind him, but go up to my
mother and lay your hands upon her knees, if you would be forwarded
on your homeward voyage.&rdquo;&nbsp; From which I conclude that Arete
ruled Alcinous, and Nausicaa ruled Arete.</p>
<p>Ulysses follows his instructions aided by Minerva, who makes him
invisible as he passes through the town and through the crowds of Ph&aelig;acian
guests who are feasting in the king&rsquo;s palace.&nbsp; When he has
reached the queen, the cloak of thick darkness falls off, and he is
revealed to all present, kneeling at the feet of Queen Arete, to whom
he makes his appeal.&nbsp; It has already been made apparent in a passage
extolling her virtue at some length, but which I have not been able
to quote, that Queen Arete is, in the eyes of the writer, a much more
important person than her husband Alcinous.</p>
<p>Every one, of course, is very much surprised at seeing Ulysses, but
after a little discussion, from which it appears that the writer considers
Alcinous to be a person who requires a good deal of keeping straight
in other matters besides clean linen, it is settled that Ulysses shall
be f&ecirc;ted on the following day and then escorted home.&nbsp; Ulysses
now has supper and remains with Alcinous and Arete after the other guests
are gone away for the night.&nbsp; So the three sit by the fire while
the servants take away the things, and Arete is the first to speak.&nbsp;
She has been uneasy for some time about Ulysses&rsquo; clothes, which
she recognized as her own make, and at last she says, &ldquo;Stranger,
there is a question or two that I should like to put to you myself.&nbsp;
Who in the world are you?&nbsp; And who gave you those clothes?&nbsp;
Did you not say you had come here from beyond the seas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulysses explains matters, but still withholds his name, nevertheless
Alcinous (who seems to have shared in the general opinion that it was
high time his daughter got married, and that, provided she married somebody,
it did not much matter who the bridegroom might be) exclaimed, &ldquo;By
Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of a person
you are and how exactly our opinions coincide upon every subject, I
should so like it if you would stay with us always, marry Nausicaa,
and become my son-in-law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ulysses turns the conversation
immediately, and meanwhile Queen Arete told her maids to put a bed in
the corridor, and make it with red blankets, and it was to have at least
one counterpane.&nbsp; They were also to put a woollen nightgown for
Ulysses.&nbsp; &ldquo;The maids took a torch, and made the bed as fast
as they could: when they had done so they came up to Ulysses and said,
&lsquo;This way, sir, if you please, your room is quite ready&rsquo;;
and Ulysses was very glad to hear them say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following day Alcinous holds a meeting of the Ph&aelig;acians
and proposes that Ulysses should have a ship got ready to take him home
at once: this being settled he invites all the leading people, and the
fifty-two sailors who are to man Ulysses&rsquo; ship, to come up to
his own house, and he will give them a banquet&mdash;for which he kills
a dozen sheep, eight pigs, and two oxen.&nbsp; Immediately after gorging
themselves at the banquet they have a series of athletic competitions,
and from this I gather the poem to have been written by one who saw
nothing very odd in letting people compete in sports requiring very
violent exercise immediately after a heavy meal.&nbsp; Such a course
may have been usual in those days, but certainly is not generally adopted
in our own.</p>
<p>At the games Alcinous makes himself as ridiculous as he always does,
and Ulysses behaves much as the hero of the preceding afternoon might
be expected to do&mdash;but on his praising the Ph&aelig;acians towards
the close of the proceedings Alcinous says he is a person of such singular
judgment that they really must all of them make him a very handsome
present.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twelve of you,&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;are
magistrates, and there is myself&mdash;that makes thirteen; suppose
we give him each one of us a clean cloak, a tunic, and a talent of gold,&rdquo;&mdash;which
in those days was worth about two hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
<p>This is unanimously agreed to, and in the evening, towards sundown,
the presents began to make their appearance at the palace of King Alcinous,
and the king&rsquo;s sons, perhaps prudently as you will presently see,
place them in the keeping of their mother Arete.</p>
<p>When the presents have all arrived, Alcinous says to Arete, &ldquo;Wife,
go and fetch the best chest we have, and put a clean cloak and a tunic
in it.&nbsp; In the meantime Ulysses will take a bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arete orders the maids to heat a bath, brings the chest, packs up
the raiment and gold which the Ph&aelig;acians have brought, and adds
a cloak and a good tunic as King Alcinous&rsquo;s own contribution.</p>
<p>Yes, but where&mdash;and that is what we are never told&mdash;is
the &pound;250 which he ought to have contributed as well as the cloak
and tunic?&nbsp; And where is the beautiful gold goblet which he had
also promised?</p>
<p>&ldquo;See to the fastening yourself,&rdquo; says Queen Arete to
Ulysses, &ldquo;for fear anyone should rob you while you are asleep
in the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulysses, we may be sure, was well aware that Alcinous&rsquo;s &pound;250
was not in the box, nor yet the goblet, but he took the hint at once
and made the chest fast without the delay of a moment, with a bond which
the cunning goddess Circe had taught him.</p>
<p>He does not seem to have thought his chance of getting the &pound;250
and the goblet, and having to unpack his box again, was so great as
his chance of having his box tampered with before he got it away, if
he neglected to double-lock it at once and put the key in his pocket.&nbsp;
He has always a keen eye to money; indeed the whole <i>Odyssey</i> turns
on what is substantially a money quarrel, so this time without the prompting
of Minerva he does one of the very few sensible things which he does,
on his own account, throughout the whole poem.</p>
<p>Supper is now served, and when it is over, Ulysses, pressed by Alcinous,
announces his name and begins the story of his adventures.</p>
<p>It is with profound regret that I find myself unable to quote any
of the fascinating episodes with which his narrative abounds, but I
have said I was going to lecture on the humour of Homer&mdash;that is
to say of the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>&mdash;and must not
be diverted from my subject.&nbsp; I cannot, however, resist the account
which Ulysses gives of his meeting with his mother in Hades, the place
of departed spirits, which he has visited by the advice of Circe.&nbsp;
His mother comes up to him and asks him how he managed to get into Hades,
being still alive.&nbsp; I will translate freely, but quite closely,
from Ulysses&rsquo; own words, as spoken to the Ph&aelig;acians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I said, &lsquo;Mother, I had to come here to consult the
ghost of the old Theban prophet Teiresias, I have never yet been near
Greece, nor set foot on my native land, and have had nothing but one
long run of ill luck from the day I set out with Agamemnon to fight
at Troy.&nbsp; But tell me how you came here yourself?&nbsp; Did you
have a long and painful illness or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle
easy passage to eternity?&nbsp; Tell me also about my father and my
son?&nbsp; Is my property still in their hands, or has someone else
got hold of it who thinks that I shall not return to claim it?&nbsp;
How, again, is my wife conducting herself?&nbsp; Does she live with
her son and make a home for him, or has she married again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother answered, &lsquo;Your wife is still mistress of
your house, but she is in very great straits and spends the greater
part of her time in tears.&nbsp; No one has actually taken possession
of your property, and Telemachus still holds it.&nbsp; He has to accept
a great many invitations, and gives much the sort of entertainments
in return that may be expected from one in his position.&nbsp; Your
father remains in the old place, and never goes near the town; he is
very badly off, and has neither bed nor bedding, nor a stick of furniture
of any kind.&nbsp; In winter he sleeps on the floor in front of the
fire with the men, and his clothes are in a shocking state, but in summer,
when the warm weather comes on again, he sleeps out in the vineyard
on a bed of vine leaves.&nbsp; He takes on very much about your not
having returned, and suffers more and more as he grows older: as for
me I died of nothing whatever in the world but grief about yourself.&nbsp;
There was not a thing the matter with me, but my prolonged anxiety on
your account was too much for me, and in the end it just wore me out.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of time Ulysses comes to a pause in his narrative and
Queen Arete makes a little speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you think,&rsquo; she said to the Ph&aelig;acians,
&lsquo;of such a guest as this?&nbsp; Did you ever see anyone at once
so good-looking and so clever?&nbsp; It is true, indeed, that his visit
is paid more particularly to myself, but you all participate in the
honour conferred upon us by a visitor of such distinction.&nbsp; Do
not be in a hurry to send him off, nor stingy in the presents you make
to one in so great need; for you are all of you very well off.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will note that the queen does not say &ldquo;<i>we</i> are all
of <i>us</i> very well off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the hero Echeneus, who was the oldest man among them,
added a few words of his own.&nbsp; &lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;there cannot be two opinions about the graciousness and sagacity
of the remarks that have just fallen from Her Majesty; nevertheless
it is with His Majesty King Alcinous that the decision must ultimately
rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The thing shall be done,&rsquo; exclaimed Alcinous,
&lsquo;if I am still king over the Ph&aelig;acians.&nbsp; As for our
guest, I know he is anxious to resume his journey, still we must persuade
him if we can to stay with us until to-morrow, by which time I shall
be able to get together the balance of the sum which I mean to press
on his acceptance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here we have it straight out that the monarch knew he had only
contributed the coat and waistcoat, and did not know exactly how he
was to lay his hands on the &pound;250.&nbsp; What with piracy&mdash;for
we have been told of at least one case in which Alcinous had looted
a town and stolen his housemaid Eurymedusa&mdash;what with insufficient
changes of linen, toping like an immortal god, swaggering at large,
and open-handed hospitality, it is plain and by no means surprising
that Alcinous is out at elbows; nor can there be a better example of
the difference between the occasional broad comedy of the <i>Iliad</i>
and the delicate but very bitter satire of the <i>Odyssey</i> than the
way in which the fact that Alcinous is in money difficulties is allowed
to steal upon us, as contrasted with the obvious humour of the quarrels
between Jove and Juno.&nbsp; At any rate we can hardly wonder at Ulysses
having felt that to a monarch of such mixed character the unfastened
box might prove a temptation greater than he could resist.&nbsp; To
return, however, to the story&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it please your Majesty,&rdquo; said he, in answer to King
Alcinous, &ldquo;I should be delighted to stay here for another twelve
months, and to accept from your hands the vast treasures and the escort
which you are go generous as to promise me.&nbsp; I should obviously
gain by doing so, for I should return fuller-handed to my own people
and should thus be both more respected and more loved by my acquaintance.&nbsp;
Still to receive such presents&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king perceived his embarrassment, and at once relieved him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;who looks at you can for
one moment take you for a charlatan or a swindler.&nbsp; I know there
are many of these unscrupulous persons going about just now with such
plausible stories that it is very hard to disbelieve them; there is,
however, a finish about your style which convinces me of your good disposition,&rdquo;
and so on for more than I have space to quote; after which Ulysses again
proceeds with his adventures.</p>
<p>When he had finished them Alcinous insists that the leading Ph&aelig;acians
should each one of them give Ulysses a still further present of a large
kitchen copper and a three-legged stand to set it on, &ldquo;but,&rdquo;
he continues, &ldquo;as the expense of all these presents is really
too heavy for the purse of any private individual, I shall charge the
whole of them on the rates&rdquo;: literally, &ldquo;We will repay ourselves
by getting it in from among the people, for this is too heavy a present
for the purse of a private individual.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what this can
mean except charging it on the rates I do not know.</p>
<p>Of course everyone else sends up his tripod and his cauldron, but
we hear nothing about any, either tripod or cauldron, from King Alcinous.&nbsp;
He is very fussy next morning stowing them under the ship&rsquo;s benches,
but his time and trouble seem to be the extent of his contribution.&nbsp;
It is hardly necessary to say that Ulysses had to go away without the
&pound;250, and that we never hear of the promised goblet being presented.&nbsp;
Still he had done pretty well.</p>
<p>I have not quoted anything like all the absurd remarks made by Alcinous,
nor shown you nearly as completely as I could do if I had more time
how obviously the writer is quietly laughing at him in her sleeve.&nbsp;
She understands his little ways as she understands those of Menelaus,
who tells Telemachus and Pisistratus that if they like he will take
them a personally conducted tour round the Peloponnese, and that they
can make a good thing out of it, for everyone will give them something&mdash;fancy
Helen or Queen Arete making such a proposal as this.&nbsp; They are
never laughed at, but then they are women, whereas Alcinous and Menelaus
are men, and this makes all the difference.</p>
<p>And now in conclusion let me point out the irony of literature in
connection with this astonishing work.&nbsp; Here is a poem in which
the hero and heroine have already been married many years before it
begins: it is marked by a total absence of love-business in such sense
as we understand it: its interest centres mainly in the fact of a bald
elderly gentleman, whose little remaining hair is red, being eaten out
of house and home during his absence by a number of young men who are
courting the supposed widow&mdash;a widow who, if she be fair and fat,
can hardly also be less than forty.&nbsp; Can any subject seem more
hopeless?&nbsp; Moreover, this subject so initially faulty is treated
with a carelessness in respect of consistency, ignorance of commonly
known details, and disregard of ordinary canons, that can hardly be
surpassed, and yet I cannot think that in the whole range of literature
there is a work which can be decisively placed above it.&nbsp; I am
afraid you will hardly accept this; I do not see how you can be expected
to do so, for in the first place there is no even tolerable prose translation,
and in the second, the <i>Odyssey</i>, like the <i>Iliad</i>, has been
a school book for over two thousand five hundred years, and what more
cruel revenge than this can dullness take on genius?&nbsp; The <i>Iliad</i>
and <i>Odyssey</i> have been used as text-books for education during
at least two thousand five hundred years, and yet it is only during
the last forty or fifty that people have begun to see that they are
by different authors.&nbsp; There was, indeed, so I learn from Colonel
Mure&rsquo;s valuable work, a band of scholars some few hundreds of
years before the birth of Christ, who refused to see the <i>Iliad</i>
and <i>Odyssey</i> as by the same author, but they were snubbed and
snuffed out, and for more than two thousand years were considered to
have been finally refuted.&nbsp; Can there be any more scathing satire
upon the value of literary criticism?&nbsp; It would seem as though
Minerva had shed the same thick darkness over both the poems as she
shed over Ulysses, so that they might go in and out among the dons of
Oxford and Cambridge from generation to generation, and none should
see them.&nbsp; If I am right, as I believe I am, in holding the <i>Odyssey</i>
to have been written by a young woman, was ever sleeping beauty more
effectually concealed behind a more impenetrable hedge of dulness?&mdash;and
she will have to sleep a good many years yet before anyone wakes her
effectually.&nbsp; But what else can one expect from people, not one
of whom has been at the very slight exertion of noting a few of the
writer&rsquo;s main topographical indications, and then looking for
them in an Admiralty chart or two?&nbsp; Can any step be more obvious
and easy&mdash;indeed, it is so simple that I am ashamed of myself for
not having taken it forty years ago.&nbsp; Students of the <i>Odyssey</i>
for the most part are so engrossed with the force of the zeugma, and
of the enclitic particle y&epsilon;; they take so much more interest
in the digamma and in the &AElig;olic dialect, than they do in the living
spirit that sits behind all these things and alone gives them their
importance, that, naturally enough, not caring about the personality,
it remains and always must remain invisible to them.</p>
<p>If I have helped to make it any less invisible to yourselves, let
me ask you to pardon the somewhat querulous tone of my concluding remarks.</p>
<h2>Quis Desiderio . . .? <a name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99">{99}</a></h2>
<p>Like Mr. Wilkie Collins, I, too, have been asked to lay some of my
literary experiences before the readers of the <i>Universal Review</i>.&nbsp;
It occurred to me that the <i>Review</i> must be indeed universal before
it could open its pages to one so obscure as myself; but, nothing daunted
by the distinguished company among which I was for the first time asked
to move, I resolved to do as I was told, and went to the British Museum
to see what books I had written.&nbsp; Having refreshed my memory by
a glance at the catalogue, I was about to try and diminish the large
and ever-increasing circle of my non-readers when I became aware of
a calamity that brought me to a standstill, and indeed bids fair, so
far as I can see at present, to put an end to my literary existence
altogether.</p>
<p>I should explain that I cannot write unless I have a sloping desk,
and the reading-room of the British Museum, where alone I can compose
freely, is unprovided with sloping desks.&nbsp; Like every other organism,
if I cannot get exactly what I want I make shift with the next thing
to it; true, there are no desks in the reading-room, but, as I once
heard a visitor from the country say, &ldquo;it contains a large number
of very interesting works.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know it was not right, and
hope the Museum authorities will not be severe upon me if any of them
reads this confession; but I wanted a desk, and set myself to consider
which of the many very interesting works which a grateful nation places
at the disposal of its would-be authors was best suited for my purpose.</p>
<p>For mere reading I suppose one book is pretty much as good as another;
but the choice of a desk-book is a more serious matter.&nbsp; It must
be neither too thick nor too thin; it must be large enough to make a
substantial support; it must be strongly bound so as not to yield or
give; it must not be too troublesome to carry backwards and forwards;
and it must live on shelf C, D, or E, so that there need be no stooping
or reaching too high.&nbsp; These are the conditions which a really
good book must fulfil; simple, however, as they are, it is surprising
how few volumes comply with them satisfactorily; moreover, being perhaps
too sensitively conscientious, I allowed another consideration to influence
me, and was sincerely anxious not to take a book which would be in constant
use for reference by readers, more especially as, if I did this, I might
find myself disturbed by the officials.</p>
<p>For weeks I made experiments upon sundry poetical and philosophical
works, whose names I have forgotten, but could not succeed in finding
my ideal desk, until at length, more by luck than cunning, I happened
to light upon Frost&rsquo;s <i>Lives of Eminent Christians</i>, which
I had no sooner tried than I discovered it to be the very perfection
and <i>ne plus ultra</i> of everything that a book should be.&nbsp;
It lived in Case No. 2008, and I accordingly took at once to sitting
in Row B, where for the last dozen years or so I have sat ever since.</p>
<p>The first thing I have done whenever I went to the Museum has been
to take down Frost&rsquo;s <i>Lives of Eminent Christians</i> and carry
it to my seat.&nbsp; It is not the custom of modern writers to refer
to the works to which they are most deeply indebted, and I have never,
that I remember, mentioned it by name before; but it is to this book
alone that I have looked for support during many years of literary labour,
and it is round this to me invaluable volume that all my own have page
by page grown up.&nbsp; There is none in the Museum to which I have
been under anything like such constant obligation, none which I can
so ill spare, and none which I would choose so readily if I were allowed
to select one single volume and keep it for my own.</p>
<p>On finding myself asked for a contribution to the <i>Universal Review</i>,
I went, as I have explained, to the Museum, and presently repaired to
bookcase No. 2008 to get my favourite volume.&nbsp; Alas! it was in
the room no longer.&nbsp; It was not in use, for its place was filled
up already; besides, no one ever used it but myself.&nbsp; Whether the
ghost of the late Mr. Frost has been so eminently unchristian as to
interfere, or whether the authorities have removed the book in ignorance
of the steady demand which there has been for it on the part of at least
one reader, are points I cannot determine.&nbsp; All I know is that
the book is gone, and I feel as Wordsworth is generally supposed to
have felt when he became aware that Lucy was in her grave, and exclaimed
so emphatically that this would make a considerable difference to him,
or words to that effect.</p>
<p>Now I think of it, Frost&rsquo;s <i>Lives of Eminent Christians</i>
was very like Lucy.&nbsp; The one resided at Dovedale in Derbyshire,
the other in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury.&nbsp; I admit that I
do not see the resemblance here at this moment, but if I try to develop
my perception I shall doubtless ere long find a marvellously striking
one.&nbsp; In other respects, however, than mere local habitat the likeness
is obvious.&nbsp; Lucy was not particularly attractive either inside
or out&mdash;no more was Frost&rsquo;s <i>Lives of Eminent Christians</i>;
there were few to praise her, and of those few still fewer could bring
themselves to like her; indeed, Wordsworth himself seems to have been
the only person who thought much about her one way or the other.&nbsp;
In like manner, I believe I was the only reader who thought much one
way or the other about Frost&rsquo;s <i>Lives of Eminent Christians</i>,
but this in itself was one of the attractions of the book; and as for
the grief we respectively felt and feel, I believe my own to be as deep
as Wordsworth&rsquo;s, if not more so.</p>
<p>I said above, &ldquo;as Wordsworth is generally supposed to have
felt&rdquo;; for anyone imbued with the spirit of modern science will
read Wordsworth&rsquo;s poem with different eyes from those of a mere
literary critic.&nbsp; He will note that Wordsworth is most careful
not to explain the nature of the difference which the death of Lucy
will occasion to him.&nbsp; He tells us that there will be a difference;
but there the matter ends.&nbsp; The superficial reader takes it that
he was very sorry she was dead; it is, of course, possible that he may
have actually been so, but he has not said this.&nbsp; On the contrary,
he has hinted plainly that she was ugly, and generally disliked; she
was only like a violet when she was half-hidden from the view, and only
fair as a star when there were so few stars out that it was practically
impossible to make an invidious comparison.&nbsp; If there were as many
as even two stars the likeness was felt to be at an end.&nbsp; If Wordsworth
had imprudently promised to marry this young person during a time when
he had been unusually long in keeping to good resolutions, and had afterwards
seen someone whom he liked better, then Lucy&rsquo;s death would undoubtedly
have made a considerable difference to him, and this is all that he
has ever said that it would do.&nbsp; What right have we to put glosses
upon the masterly reticence of a poet, and credit him with feelings
possibly the very reverse of those he actually entertained?</p>
<p>Sometimes, indeed, I have been inclined to think that a mystery is
being hinted at more dark than any critic has suspected.&nbsp; I do
not happen to possess a copy of the poem, but the writer, if I am not
mistaken, says that &ldquo;few could know when Lucy ceased to be.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ceased to be&rdquo; is a suspiciously euphemistic expression,
and the words &ldquo;few could know&rdquo; are not applicable to the
ordinary peaceful death of a domestic servant such as Lucy appears to
have been.&nbsp; No matter how obscure the deceased, any number of people
commonly can know the day and hour of his or her demise, whereas in
this case we are expressly told it would be impossible for them to do
so.&nbsp; Wordsworth was nothing if not accurate, and would not have
said that few could know, but that few actually did know, unless he
was aware of circumstances that precluded all but those implicated in
the crime of her death from knowing the precise moment of its occurrence.&nbsp;
If Lucy was the kind of person not obscurely portrayed in the poem;
if Wordsworth had murdered her, either by cutting her throat or smothering
her, in concert, perhaps, with his friends Southey and Coleridge; and
if he had thus found himself released from an engagement which had become
irksome to him, or possibly from the threat of an action for breach
of promise, then there is not a syllable in the poem with which he crowns
his crime that is not alive with meaning.&nbsp; On any other supposition
to the general reader it is unintelligible.</p>
<p>We cannot be too guarded in the interpretations we put upon the words
of great poets.&nbsp; Take the young lady who never loved the dear gazelle&mdash;and
I don&rsquo;t believe she did; we are apt to think that Moore intended
us to see in this creation of his fancy a sweet, amiable, but most unfortunate
young woman, whereas all he has told us about her points to an exactly
opposite conclusion.&nbsp; In reality, he wished us to see a young lady
who had been a habitual complainer from her earliest childhood; whose
plants had always died as soon as she bought them, while those belonging
to her neighbours had flourished.&nbsp; The inference is obvious, nor
can we reasonably doubt that Moore intended us to draw it; if her plants
were the very first to fade away, she was evidently the very first to
neglect or otherwise maltreat them.&nbsp; She did not give them enough
water, or left the door of her fern-case open when she was cooking her
dinner at the gas stove, or kept them too near the paraffin oil, or
other like folly; and as for her temper, see what the gazelles did;
as long as they did not know her &ldquo;well,&rdquo; they could just
manage to exist, but when they got to understand her real character,
one after another felt that death was the only course open to it, and
accordingly died rather than live with such a mistress.&nbsp; True,
the young lady herself said the gazelles loved her; but disagreeable
people are apt to think themselves amiable, and in view of the course
invariably taken by the gazelles themselves anyone accustomed to weigh
evidence will hold that she was probably mistaken.</p>
<p>I must, however, return to Frost&rsquo;s <i>Lives of Eminent Christians</i>.&nbsp;
I will leave none of the ambiguity about my words in which Moore and
Wordsworth seem to have delighted.&nbsp; I am very sorry the book is
gone, and know not where to turn for its successor.&nbsp; Till I have
found a substitute I can write no more, and I do not know how to find
even a tolerable one.&nbsp; I should try a volume of Migne&rsquo;s <i>Complete
Course of Patrology</i>, but I do not like books in more than one volume,
for the volumes vary in thickness, and one never can remember which
one took; the four volumes, however, of Bede in Giles&rsquo;s <i>Anglican
Fathers</i> are not open to this objection, and I have reserved them
for favourable consideration.&nbsp; Mather&rsquo;s <i>Magnalia</i> might
do, but the binding does not please me; Cureton&rsquo;s <i>Corpus Ignatianum</i>
might also do if it were not too thin.&nbsp; I do not like taking Norton&rsquo;s
<i>Genuineness of the Gospels</i>, as it is just possible someone may
be wanting to know whether the Gospels are genuine or not, and be unable
to find out because I have got Mr. Norton&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; Baxter&rsquo;s
<i>Church History of England</i>, Lingard&rsquo;s <i>Anglo-Saxon Church</i>,
and Cardwell&rsquo;s <i>Documentary Annals</i>, though none of them
as good as Frost, are works of considerable merit; but on the whole
I think Arvine&rsquo;s <i>Cyclopedia of Moral and Religious Anecdote</i>
is perhaps the one book in the room which comes within measurable distance
of Frost.&nbsp; I should probably try this book first, but it has a
fatal objection in its too seductive title.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not curious,&rdquo;
as Miss Lottie Venne says in one of her parts, &ldquo;but I like to
know,&rdquo; and I might be tempted to pervert the book from its natural
uses and open it, so as to find out what kind of a thing a moral and
religious anecdote is.&nbsp; I know, of course, that there are a great
many anecdotes in the Bible, but no one thinks of calling them either
moral or religious, though some of them certainly seem as if they might
fairly find a place in Mr. Arvine&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; There are some
things, however, which it is better not to know, and take it all round
I do not think I should be wise in putting myself in the way of temptation,
and adopting Arvine as the successor to my beloved and lamented Frost.</p>
<p>Some successor I must find, or I must give up writing altogether,
and this I should be sorry to do.&nbsp; I have only as yet written about
a third, or from that&mdash;counting works written but not published&mdash;to
a half of the books which I have set myself to write.&nbsp; It would
not so much matter if old age was not staring me in the face.&nbsp;
Dr. Parr said it was &ldquo;a beastly shame for an old man not to have
laid down a good cellar of port in his youth&rdquo;; I, like the greater
number, I suppose, of those who write books at all, write in order that
I may have something to read in my old age when I can write no longer.&nbsp;
I know what I shall like better than anyone can tell me, and write accordingly;
if my career is nipped in the bud, as seems only too likely, I really
do not know where else I can turn for present agreeable occupation,
nor yet how to make suitable provision for my later years.&nbsp; Other
writers can, of course, make excellent provision for their own old ages,
but they cannot do so for mine, any more than I should succeed if I
were to try to cater for theirs.&nbsp; It is one of those cases in which
no man can make agreement for his brother.</p>
<p>I have no heart for continuing this article, and if I had, I have
nothing of interest to say.&nbsp; No one&rsquo;s literary career can
have been smoother or more unchequered than mine.&nbsp; I have published
all my books at my own expense, and paid for them in due course.&nbsp;
What can be conceivably more unromantic?&nbsp; For some years I had
a little literary grievance against the authorities of the British Museum
because they would insist on saying in their catalogue that I had published
three sermons on Infidelity in the year 1820.&nbsp; I thought I had
not, and got them out to see.&nbsp; They were rather funny, but they
were not mine.&nbsp; Now, however, this grievance has been removed.&nbsp;
I had another little quarrel with them because they would describe me
as &ldquo;of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge,&rdquo; an establishment
for which I have the most profound veneration, but with which I have
not had the honour to be connected for some quarter of a century.&nbsp;
At last they said they would change this description if I would only
tell them what I was, for, though they had done their best to find out,
they had themselves failed.&nbsp; I replied with modest pride that I
was a Bachelor of Arts.&nbsp; I keep all my other letters inside my
name, not outside.&nbsp; They mused and said it was unfortunate that
I was not a Master of Arts.&nbsp; Could I not get myself made a Master?&nbsp;
I said I understood that a Mastership was an article the University
could not do under about five pounds, and that I was not disposed to
go sixpence higher than three ten.&nbsp; They again said it was a pity,
for it would be very inconvenient to them if I did not keep to something
between a bishop and a poet.&nbsp; I might be anything I liked in reason,
provided I showed proper respect for the alphabet; but they had got
me between &ldquo;Samuel Butler, bishop,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Samuel Butler,
poet.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be very troublesome to shift me, and bachelor
came before bishop.&nbsp; This was reasonable, so I replied that, under
those circumstances, if they pleased, I thought I would like to be a
philosophical writer.&nbsp; They embraced the solution, and, no matter
what I write now, I must remain a philosophical writer as long as I
live, for the alphabet will hardly be altered in my time, and I must
be something between &ldquo;Bis&rdquo; and &ldquo;Poe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If I could get a volume of my excellent namesake&rsquo;s <i>Hudibras</i>
out of the list of my works, I should be robbed of my last shred of
literary grievance, so I say nothing about this, but keep it secret,
lest some worse thing should happen to me.&nbsp; Besides, I have a great
respect for my namesake, and always say that if <i>Erewhon</i> had been
a racehorse it would have been got by <i>Hudibras</i> out of <i>Analogy</i>.&nbsp;
Someone said this to me many years ago, and I felt so much flattered
that I have been repeating the remark as my own ever since.</p>
<p>But how small are these grievances as compared with those endured
without a murmur by hundreds of writers far more deserving than myself.&nbsp;
When I see the scores and hundreds of workers in the reading-room who
have done so much more than I have, but whose work is absolutely fruitless
to themselves, and when I think of the prompt recognition obtained by
my own work, I ask myself what I have done to be thus rewarded.&nbsp;
On the other hand, the feeling that I have succeeded far beyond my deserts
hitherto, makes it all the harder for me to acquiesce without complaint
in the extinction of a career which I honestly believe to be a promising
one; and once more I repeat that, unless the Museum authorities give
me back my Frost, or put a locked clasp on Arvine, my career must be
extinguished.&nbsp; Give me back Frost, and, if life and health are
spared, I will write another dozen of volumes yet before I hang up my
fiddle&mdash;if so serious a confusion of metaphors may be pardoned.&nbsp;
I know from long experience how kind and considerate both the late and
present superintendents of the reading-room were and are, but I doubt
how far either of them would be disposed to help me on this occasion;
continue, however, to rob me of my Frost, and, whatever else I may do,
I will write no more books.</p>
<p><i>Note by Dr. Garnett</i>, <i>British Museum</i>.&mdash;The frost
has broken up.&nbsp; Mr. Butler is restored to literature.&nbsp; Mr.
Mudie may make himself easy.&nbsp; England will still boast a humorist;
and the late Mr. Darwin (to whose posthumous machinations the removal
of the book was owing) will continue to be confounded.&mdash;R. GARNETT.</p>
<h2>Ramblings in Cheapside <a name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110">{110}</a></h2>
<p>Walking the other day in Cheapside I saw some turtles in Mr. Sweeting&rsquo;s
window, and was tempted to stay and look at them.&nbsp; As I did so
I was struck not more by the defences with which they were hedged about,
than by the fatuousness of trying to hedge that in at all which, if
hedged thoroughly, must die of its own defencefulness.&nbsp; The holes
for the head and feet through which the turtle leaks out, as it were,
on to the exterior world, and through which it again absorbs the exterior
world into itself&mdash;&ldquo;catching on&rdquo; through them to things
that are thus both turtle and not turtle at one and the same time&mdash;these
holes stultify the armour, and show it to have been designed by a creature
with more of faithfulness to a fixed idea, and hence one-sidedness,
than of that quick sense of relative importances and their changes,
which is the main factor of good living.</p>
<p>The turtle obviously had no sense of proportion; it differed so widely
from myself that I could not comprehend it; and as this word occurred
to me, it occurred also that until my body comprehended its body in
a physical material sense, neither would my mind be able to comprehend
its mind with any thoroughness.&nbsp; For unity of mind can only be
consummated by unity of body; everything, therefore, must be in some
respects both knave and fool to all that which has not eaten it, or
by which it has not been eaten.&nbsp; As long as the turtle was in the
window and I in the street outside, there was no chance of our comprehending
one another.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I knew that I could get it to agree with me if I could
so effectually buttonhole and fasten on to it as to eat it.&nbsp; Most
men have an easy method with turtle soup, and I had no misgiving but
that if I could bring my first premise to bear I should prove the better
reasoner.&nbsp; My difficulty lay in this initial process, for I had
not with me the argument that would alone compel Mr. Sweeting to think
that I ought to be allowed to convert the turtles&mdash;I mean I had
no money in my pocket.&nbsp; No missionary enterprise can be carried
on without any money at all, but even so small a sum as half a crown
would, I suppose, have enabled me to bring the turtle partly round,
and with many half-crowns I could in time no doubt convert the lot,
for the turtle needs must go where the money drives.&nbsp; If, as is
alleged, the world stands on a turtle, the turtle stands on money.&nbsp;
No money no turtle.&nbsp; As for money, that stands on opinion, credit,
trust, faith&mdash;things that, though highly material in connection
with money, are still of immaterial essence.</p>
<p>The steps are perfectly plain.&nbsp; The men who caught the turtles
brought a fairly strong and definite opinion to bear upon them, that
passed into action, and later on into money.&nbsp; They thought the
turtles would come that way, and verified their opinion; on this, will
and action were generated, with the result that the men turned the turtles
on their backs and carried them off.&nbsp; Mr. Sweeting touched these
men with money, which is the outward and visible sign of verified opinion.&nbsp;
The customer touches Mr. Sweeting with money, Mr. Sweeting touches the
waiter and the cook with money.&nbsp; They touch the turtle with skill
and verified opinion.&nbsp; Finally, the customer applies the clinching
argument that brushes all sophisms aside, and bids the turtle stand
protoplasm to protoplasm with himself, to know even as it is known.</p>
<p>But it must be all touch, touch, touch; skill, opinion, power, and
money, passing in and out with one another in any order we like, but
still link to link and touch to touch.&nbsp; If there is failure anywhere
in respect of opinion, skill, power, or money, either as regards quantity
or quality, the chain can be no stronger than its weakest link, and
the turtle and the clinching argument will fly asunder.&nbsp; Of course,
if there is an initial failure in connection, through defect in any
member of the chain, or of connection between the links, it will no
more be attempted to bring the turtle and the clinching argument together,
than it will to chain up a dog with two pieces of broken chain that
are disconnected.&nbsp; The contact throughout must be conceived as
absolute; and yet perfect contact is inconceivable by us, for on becoming
perfect it ceases to be contact, and becomes essential, once for all
inseverable, identity.&nbsp; The most absolute contact short of this
is still contact by courtesy only.&nbsp; So here, as everywhere else,
Eurydice glides off as we are about to grasp her.&nbsp; We can see nothing
face to face; our utmost seeing is but a fumbling of blind finger-ends
in an overcrowded pocket.</p>
<p>Presently my own blind finger-ends fished up the conclusion, that
as I had neither time nor money to spend on perfecting the chain that
would put me in full spiritual contact with Mr. Sweeting&rsquo;s turtles,
I had better leave them to complete their education at someone else&rsquo;s
expense rather than mine, so I walked on towards the Bank.&nbsp; As
I did so it struck me how continually we are met by this melting of
one existence into another.&nbsp; The limits of the body seem well defined
enough as definitions go, but definitions seldom go far.&nbsp; What,
for example, can seem more distinct from a man than his banker or his
solicitor?&nbsp; Yet these are commonly so much parts of him that he
can no more cut them off and grow new ones, than he can grow new legs
or arms; neither must he wound his solicitor; a wound in the solicitor
is a very serious thing.&nbsp; As for his bank&mdash;failure of his
bank&rsquo;s action may be as fatal to a man <i>as</i> failure of his
heart.&nbsp; I have said nothing about the medical or spiritual adviser,
but most men grow into the society that surrounds them by the help of
these four main tap-roots, and not only into the world of humanity,
but into the universe at large.&nbsp; We can, indeed, grow butchers,
bakers, and greengrocers, almost <i>ad libitum</i>, but these are low
developments, and correspond to skin, hair, or finger-nails.&nbsp; Those
of us again who are not highly enough organized to have grown a solicitor
or banker can generally repair the loss of whatever social organization
they may possess as freely as lizards are said to grow new tails; but
this with the higher social, as well as organic, developments is only
possible to a very limited extent.</p>
<p>The doctrine of metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls&mdash;a
doctrine to which the foregoing considerations are for the most part
easy corollaries&mdash;crops up no matter in what direction we allow
our thoughts to wander.&nbsp; And we meet instances of transmigration
of body as well as of soul.&nbsp; I do not mean that both body and soul
have transmigrated together, far from it; but that, as we can often
recognize a transmigrated mind in an alien body, so we not less often
see a body that is clearly only a transmigration, linked on to someone
else&rsquo;s new and alien soul.&nbsp; We meet people every day whose
bodies are evidently those of men and women long dead, but whose appearance
we know through their portraits.&nbsp; We see them going about in omnibuses,
railway carriages, and in all public places.&nbsp; The cards have been
shuffled, and they have drawn fresh lots in life and nationalities,
but anyone fairly well up in medieval and last-century portraiture knows
them at a glance.</p>
<p>Going down once towards Italy I saw a young man in the train whom
I recognized, only he seemed to have got younger.&nbsp; He was with
a friend, and his face was in continual play, but for some little time
I puzzled in vain to recollect where it was that I had seen him before.&nbsp;
All of a sudden I remembered he was King Francis I of France.&nbsp;
I had hitherto thought the face of this king impossible, but when I
saw it in play I understood it.&nbsp; His great contemporary Henry VIII
keeps a restaurant in Oxford Street.&nbsp; Falstaff drove one of the
St. Gothard diligences for many years, and only retired when the railway
was opened.&nbsp; Titian once made me a pair of boots at Vicenza, and
not very good ones.&nbsp; At Modena I had my hair cut by a young man
whom I perceived to be Raffaelle.&nbsp; The model who sat to him for
his celebrated Madonnas is first lady in a confectionery establishment
at Montreal.&nbsp; She has a little motherly pimple on the left side
of her nose that is misleading at first, but on examination she is readily
recognized; probably Raffaelle&rsquo;s model had the pimple too, but
Raffaelle left it out&mdash;as he would.</p>
<p>Handel, of course, is Madame Patey.&nbsp; Give Madame Patey Handel&rsquo;s
wig and clothes, and there would be no telling her from Handel.&nbsp;
It is not only that the features and the shape of the head are the same,
but there is a certain imperiousness of expression and attitude about
Handel which he hardly attempts to conceal in Madame Patey.&nbsp; It
is a curious coincidence that he should continue to be such an incomparable
renderer of his own music.&nbsp; Pope Julius II was the late Mr. Darwin.&nbsp;
Rameses II is a blind woman now, and stands in Holborn, holding a tin
mug.&nbsp; I never could understand why I always found myself humming
&ldquo;They oppressed them with burthens&rdquo; when I passed her, till
one day I was looking in Mr. Spooner&rsquo;s window in the Strand, and
saw a photograph of Rameses II.&nbsp; Mary Queen of Scots wears surgical
boots and is subject to fits, near the Horse Shoe in Tottenham Court
Road.</p>
<p>Michael Angelo is a commissionaire; I saw him on board the <i>Glen
Rosa</i>, which used to run every day from London to Clacton-on-Sea
and back.&nbsp; It gave me quite a turn when I saw him coming down the
stairs from the upper deck, with his bronzed face, flattened nose, and
with the familiar bar upon his forehead.&nbsp; I never liked Michael
Angelo, and never shall, but I am afraid of him, and was near trying
to hide when I saw him coming towards me.&nbsp; He had not got his commissionaire&rsquo;s
uniform on, and I did not know he was one till I met him a month or
so later in the Strand.&nbsp; When we got to Blackwall the music struck
up and people began to dance.&nbsp; I never saw a man dance so much
in my life.&nbsp; He did not miss a dance all the way to Clacton, nor
all the way back again, and when not dancing he was flirting and cracking
jokes.&nbsp; I could hardly believe my eyes when I reflected that this
man had painted the famous &ldquo;Last Judgment,&rdquo; and had made
all those statues.</p>
<p>Dante is, or was a year or two ago, a waiter at Brissago on the Lago
Maggiore, only he is better-tempered-looking, and has a more intellectual
expression.&nbsp; He gave me his ideas upon beauty: &ldquo;Tutto ch&rsquo;
&egrave; vero &egrave; bello,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with all his old
self-confidence.&nbsp; I am not afraid of Dante.&nbsp; I know people
by their friends, and he went about with Virgil, so I said with some
severity, &ldquo;No, Dante, il naso della Signora Robinson &egrave;
vero, ma non &egrave; bello&rdquo;; and he admitted I was right.&nbsp;
Beatrice&rsquo;s name is Towler; she is waitress at a small inn in German
Switzerland.&nbsp; I used to sit at my window and hear people call &ldquo;Towler,
Towler, Towler,&rdquo; fifty times in a forenoon.&nbsp; She was the
exact antithesis to Abra; Abra, if I remember, used to come before they
called her name, but no matter how often they called Towler, everyone
came before she did.&nbsp; I suppose they spelt her name Taula, but
to me it sounded Towler; I never, however, met anyone else with this
name.&nbsp; She was a sweet, artless little hussy, who made me play
the piano to her, and she said it was lovely.&nbsp; Of course I only
played my own compositions; so I believed her, and it all went off very
nicely.&nbsp; I thought it might save trouble if I did not tell her
who she really was, so I said nothing about it.</p>
<p>I met Socrates once.&nbsp; He was my muleteer on an excursion which
I will not name, for fear it should identify the man.&nbsp; The moment
I saw my guide I knew he was somebody, but for the life of me I could
not remember who.&nbsp; All of a sudden it flashed across me that he
was Socrates.&nbsp; He talked enough for six, but it was all in <i>dialetto</i>,
so I could not understand him, nor, when I had discovered who he was,
did I much try to do so.&nbsp; He was a good creature, a trifle given
to stealing fruit and vegetables, but an amiable man enough.&nbsp; He
had had a long day with his mule and me, and he only asked me five francs.&nbsp;
I gave him ten, for I pitied his poor old patched boots, and there was
a meekness about him that touched me.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, Socrates,&rdquo;
said I at parting, &ldquo;we go on our several ways, you to steal tomatoes,
I to filch ideas from other people; for the rest&mdash;which of these
two roads will be the better going, our father which is in heaven knows,
but we know not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have never seen Mendelssohn, but there is a fresco of him on the
terrace, or open-air dining-room, of an inn at Chiavenna.&nbsp; He is
not called Mendelssohn, but I knew him by his legs.&nbsp; He is in the
costume of a dandy of some five-and-forty years ago, is smoking a cigar,
and appears to be making an offer of marriage to his cook.&nbsp; Beethoven
both my friend Mr. H. Festing Jones and I have had the good fortune
to meet; he is an engineer now, and does not know one note from another;
he has quite lost his deafness, is married, and is, of course, a little
squat man with the same refractory hair that he always had.&nbsp; It
was very interesting to watch him, and Jones remarked that before the
end of dinner he had become positively posthumous.&nbsp; One morning
I was told the Beethovens were going away, and before long I met their
two heavy boxes being carried down the stairs.&nbsp; The boxes were
so squab and like their owners, that I half thought for a moment that
they were inside, and should hardly have been surprised to see them
spring up like a couple of Jacks-in-the-box.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sono indentro?&rdquo;
said I, with a frown of wonder, pointing to the boxes.&nbsp; The porters
knew what I meant, and laughed.&nbsp; But there is no end to the list
of people whom I have been able to recognize, and before I had got through
it myself, I found I had walked some distance, and had involuntarily
paused in front of a second-hand bookstall.</p>
<p>I do not like books.&nbsp; I believe I have the smallest library
of any literary man in London, and I have no wish to increase it.&nbsp;
I keep my books at the British Museum and at Mudie&rsquo;s, and it makes
me very angry if anyone gives me one for my private library.&nbsp; I
once heard two ladies disputing in a railway carriage as to whether
one of them had or had not been wasting money.&nbsp; &ldquo;I spent
it in books,&rdquo; said the accused, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s not wasting
money to buy books.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed, my dear, I think it
is,&rdquo; was the rejoinder, and in practice I agree with it.&nbsp;
Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary, Whitaker&rsquo;s Almanack, and Bradshaw&rsquo;s
Railway Guide should be sufficient for any ordinary library; it will
be time enough to go beyond these when the mass of useful and entertaining
matter which they provide has been mastered.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I admit
that sometimes, if not particularly busy, I stop at a second-hand bookstall
and turn over a book or two from mere force of habit.</p>
<p>I know not what made me pick up a copy of &AElig;schylus&mdash;of
course in an English version&mdash;or rather I know not what made &AElig;schylus
take up with me, for he took me rather than I him; but no sooner had
he got me than he began puzzling me, as he has done any time this forty
years, to know wherein his transcendent merit can be supposed to lie.&nbsp;
To me he is, like the greater number of classics in all ages and countries,
a literary Struldbrug, rather than a true ambrosia-fed immortal.&nbsp;
There are true immortals, but they are few and far between; most classics
are as great impostors dead as they were when living, and while posing
as gods are, five-sevenths of them, only Struldbrugs.&nbsp; It comforts
me to remember that Aristophanes liked &AElig;schylus no better than
I do.&nbsp; True, he praises him by comparison with Sophocles and Euripides,
but he only does so that he may run down these last more effectively.&nbsp;
Aristophanes is a safe man to follow, nor do I see why it should not
be as correct to laugh with him as to pull a long face with the Greek
Professors; but this is neither here nor there, for no one really cares
about &AElig;schylus; the more interesting question is how he contrived
to make so many people for so many years pretend to care about him.</p>
<p>Perhaps he married somebody&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; If a man would
get hold of the public ear, he must pay, marry, or fight.&nbsp; I have
never understood that <i>&AElig;schylus</i> was a man of means, and
the fighters do not write poetry, so I suppose he must have married
a theatrical manager&rsquo;s daughter, and got his plays brought out
that way.&nbsp; The ear of any age or country is like its land, air,
and water; it seems limitless but is really limited, and is already
in the keeping of those who naturally enough will have no squatting
on such valuable property.&nbsp; It is written and talked up to as closely
as the means of subsistence are bred up to by a teeming population.&nbsp;
There is not a square inch of it but is in private hands, and he who
would freehold any part of it must do so by purchase, marriage, or fighting,
in the usual way&mdash;and fighting gives the longest, safest tenure.&nbsp;
The public itself has hardly more voice in the question who shall have
its ear, than the land has in choosing its owners.&nbsp; It is farmed
as those who own it think most profitable to themselves, and small blame
to them; nevertheless, it has a residuum of mulishness which the land
has not, and does sometimes dispossess its tenants.&nbsp; It is in this
residuum that those who fight place their hope and trust.</p>
<p>Or perhaps &AElig;schylus squared the leading critics of his time.&nbsp;
When one comes to think of it, he must have done so, for how is it conceivable
that such plays should have had such runs if he had not?&nbsp; I met
a lady one year in Switzerland who had some parrots that always travelled
with her and were the idols of her life.&nbsp; These parrots would not
let anyone read aloud in their presence, unless they heard their own
names introduced from time to time.&nbsp; If these were freely interpolated
into the text they would remain as still as stones, for they thought
the reading was about themselves.&nbsp; If it was not about them it
could not be allowed.&nbsp; The leaders of literature are like these
parrots; they do not look at what a man writes, nor if they did would
they understand it much better than the parrots do; but they like the
sound of their own names, and if these are freely interpolated in a
tone they take as friendly, they may even give ear to an outsider.&nbsp;
Otherwise they will scream him off if they can.</p>
<p>I should not advise anyone with ordinary independence of mind to
attempt the public ear unless he is confident that he can out-lung and
out-last his own generation; for if he has any force, people will and
ought to be on their guard against him, inasmuch as there is no knowing
where he may not take them.&nbsp; Besides, they have staked their money
on the wrong men so often without suspecting it, that when there comes
one whom they do suspect it would be madness not to bet against him.&nbsp;
True, he may die before he has out screamed his opponents, but that
has nothing to do with it.&nbsp; If his scream was well pitched it will
sound clearer when he is dead.&nbsp; We do not know what death is.&nbsp;
If we know so little about life which we have experienced, how shall
we know about death which we have not&mdash;and in the nature of things
never can?&nbsp; Everyone, as I said years ago in <i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i>,
is an immortal to himself, for he cannot know that he is dead until
he is dead, and when dead how can he know anything about anything?&nbsp;
All we know is, that even the humblest dead may live long after all
trace of the body has disappeared; we see them doing it in the bodies
and memories of those that come after them; and not a few live so much
longer and more effectually than is desirable, that it has been necessary
to get rid of them by Act of Parliament.&nbsp; It is love that alone
gives life, and the truest life is that which we live not in ourselves
but vicariously in others, and with which we have no concern.&nbsp;
Our concern is so to order ourselves that we may be of the number of
them that enter into life&mdash;although we know it not.</p>
<p>&AElig;schylus did so order himself; but his life is not of that
inspiriting kind that can be won through fighting the good fight only&mdash;or
being believed to have fought it.&nbsp; His voice is the echo of a drone,
drone-begotten and drone-sustained.&nbsp; It is not a tone that a man
must utter or die&mdash;nay, even though he die; and likely enough half
the allusions and hard passages in &AElig;schylus of which we can make
neither head nor tail are in reality only puffs of some of the literary
leaders of his time.</p>
<p>The lady above referred to told me more about her parrots.&nbsp;
She was like a Nasmyth&rsquo;s hammer going slow&mdash;very gentle,
but irresistible.&nbsp; She always read the newspaper to them.&nbsp;
What was the use of having a newspaper if one did not read it to one&rsquo;s
parrots?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you divined,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;to which side
they incline in politics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not like Mr. Gladstone,&rdquo; was the somewhat freezing
answer; &ldquo;this is the only point on which we disagree, for I adore
him.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ask more about this, it is a great grief to me.&nbsp;
I tell them everything,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and hide no secret
from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can any parrot be trusted to keep a secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And on Sundays do you give them the same course of reading
as on a week-day, or do you make a difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Sundays I always read them a genealogical chapter from
the Old or New Testament, for I can thus introduce their names without
profanity.&nbsp; I always keep tea by me in case they should ask for
it in the night, and I have an Etna to warm it for them; they take milk
and sugar.&nbsp; The old white-headed clergyman came to see them last
night; it was very painful, for Jocko reminded him so strongly of his
late . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought she was going to say &ldquo;wife,&rdquo; but it proved
to have been only of a parrot that he had once known and loved.</p>
<p>One evening she was in difficulties about the quarantine, which was
enforced that year on the Italian frontier.&nbsp; The local doctor had
gone down that morning to see the Italian doctor and arrange some details.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then, perhaps, my dear,&rdquo; she said to her husband, &ldquo;he
is the quarantine.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, my love,&rdquo; replied her
husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;The quarantine is not a person, it is a place
where they put people&rdquo;; but she would not be comforted, and suspected
the quarantine as an enemy that might at any moment pounce out upon
her and her parrots.&nbsp; So a lady told me once that she had been
in like trouble about the anthem.&nbsp; She read in her Prayer Book
that in choirs and places where they sing &ldquo;here followeth the
anthem,&rdquo; yet the person with this most mysteriously sounding name
never did follow.&nbsp; They had a choir, and no one could say the church
was not a place where they sang, for they did sing&mdash;both chants
and hymns.&nbsp; Why, then, this persistent slackness on the part of
the anthem, who at this juncture should follow her papa, the rector,
into the reading-desk?&nbsp; No doubt he would come some day, and then
what would he be like?&nbsp; Fair or dark?&nbsp; Tall or short?&nbsp;
Would he be bald and wear spectacles like papa, would he be young and
good-looking?&nbsp; Anyhow, there was something wrong, for it was announced
that he would follow, and he never did follow; therefore there was no
knowing what he might not do next.</p>
<p>I heard of the parrots a year or two later as giving lessons in Italian
to an English maid.&nbsp; I do not know what their terms were.&nbsp;
Alas! since then both they and their mistress have joined the majority.&nbsp;
When the poor lady felt her end was near she desired (and the responsibility
for this must rest with her, not me) that the birds might be destroyed,
as fearing that they might come to be neglected, and knowing that they
could never be loved again as she had loved them.&nbsp; On being told
that all was over, she said, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and immediately
expired.</p>
<p>Reflecting in such random fashion, and strolling with no greater
method, I worked my way back through Cheapside and found myself once
more in front of Sweeting&rsquo;s window.&nbsp; Again the turtles attracted
me.&nbsp; They were alive, and so far at any rate they agreed with me.&nbsp;
Nay, they had eyes, mouths, legs, if not arms, and feet, so there was
much in which we were both of a mind, but surely they must be mistaken
in arming themselves so very heavily.&nbsp; Any creature on getting
what the turtle aimed at would overreach itself and be landed not in
safety but annihilation.&nbsp; It should have no communion with the
outside world at all, for death could creep in wherever the creature
could creep out; and it must creep out somewhere if it was to hook on
to outside things.&nbsp; What death can be more absolute than such absolute
isolation?&nbsp; Perfect death, indeed, if it were attainable (which
it is not), is as near perfect security as we can reach, but it is not
the kind of security aimed at by any animal that is at the pains of
defending itself.&nbsp; For such want to have things both ways, desiring
the livingness of life without its perils, and the safety of death without
its deadness, and some of us do actually get this for a considerable
time, but we do not get it by plating ourselves with armour as the turtle
does.&nbsp; We tried this in the Middle Ages, and no longer mock ourselves
with the weight of armour that our forefathers carried in battle.&nbsp;
Indeed the more deadly the weapons of attack become the more we go into
the fight slug-wise.</p>
<p>Slugs have ridden their contempt for defensive armour as much to
death as the turtles their pursuit of it.&nbsp; They have hardly more
than skin enough to hold themselves together; they court death every
time they cross the road.&nbsp; Yet death comes not to them more than
to the turtle, whose defences are so great that there is little left
inside to be defended.&nbsp; Moreover, the slugs fare best in the long
run, for turtles are dying out, while slugs are not, and there must
be millions of slugs all the world over for every single turtle.&nbsp;
Of the two vanities, therefore, that of the slug seems most substantial.</p>
<p>In either case the creature thinks itself safe, but is sure to be
found out sooner or later; nor is it easy to explain this mockery save
by reflecting that everything must have its meat in due season, and
that meat can only be found for such a multitude of mouths by giving
everything as meat in due season to something else.&nbsp; This is like
the Kilkenny cats, or robbing Peter to pay Paul; but it is the way of
the world, and as every animal must contribute in kind to the picnic
of the universe, one does not see what better arrangement could be made
than the providing each race with a hereditary fallacy, which shall
in the end get it into a scrape, but which shall generally stand the
wear and tear of life for some time.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Do ut des</i>&rdquo;
is the writing on all flesh to him that eats it; and no creature is
dearer to itself than it is to some other that would devour it.</p>
<p>Nor is there any statement or proposition more invulnerable than
living forms are.&nbsp; Propositions prey upon and are grounded upon
one another just like living forms.&nbsp; They support one another as
plants and animals do; they are based ultimately on credit, or faith,
rather than the cash of irrefragable conviction.&nbsp; The whole universe
is carried on on the credit system, and if the mutual confidence on
which it is based were to collapse, it must itself collapse immediately.&nbsp;
Just or unjust, it lives by faith; it is based on vague and impalpable
opinion that by some inscrutable process passes into will and action,
and is made manifest in matter and in flesh: it is meteoric&mdash;suspended
in mid-air; it is the baseless fabric of a vision so vast, so vivid,
and so gorgeous that no base can seem more broad than such stupendous
baselessness, and yet any man can bring it about his ears by being over-curious;
when faith fails, a system based on faith fails also.</p>
<p>Whether the universe is really a paying concern, or whether it is
an inflated bubble that must burst sooner or later, this is another
matter.&nbsp; If people were to demand cash payment in irrefragable
certainty for everything that they have taken hitherto as paper money
on the credit of the bank of public opinion, is there money enough behind
it all to stand so great a drain even on so great a reserve?&nbsp; Probably
there is not, but happily there can be no such panic, for even though
the cultured classes may do so, the uncultured are too dull to have
brains enough to commit such stupendous folly.&nbsp; It takes a long
course of academic training to educate a man up to the standard which
he must reach before he can entertain such questions seriously, and
by a merciful dispensation of Providence university training is almost
as costly as it is unprofitable.&nbsp; The majority will thus be always
unable to afford it, and will base their opinions on mother wit and
current opinion rather than on demonstration.</p>
<p>So I turned my steps homewards; I saw a good many more things on
my way home, but I was told that I was not to see more this time than
I could get into twelve pages of the <i>Universal Review</i>; I must
therefore reserve any remark which I think might perhaps entertain the
reader for another occasion.</p>
<h2>The Aunt, the Nieces, and the Dog <a name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127">{127}</a></h2>
<p>When a thing is old, broken, and useless we throw it on the dust-heap,
but when it is sufficiently old, sufficiently broken, and sufficiently
useless we give money for it, put it into a museum, and read papers
over it which people come long distances to hear.&nbsp; By and by, when
the whirligig of time has brought on another revenge, the museum itself
becomes a dust-heap, and remains so till after long ages it is rediscovered,
and valued as belonging to a neo-rubbish age&mdash;containing, perhaps,
traces of a still older paleo-rubbish civilization.&nbsp; So when people
are old, indigent, and in all respects incapable, we hold them in greater
and greater contempt as their poverty and impotence increase, till they
reach the pitch when they are actually at the point to die, whereon
they become sublime.&nbsp; Then we place every resource our hospitals
can command at their disposal, and show no stint in our consideration
for them.</p>
<p>It is the same with all our interests.&nbsp; We care most about extremes
of importance and of unimportance; but extremes of importance are tainted
with fear, and a very imperfect fear casteth out love.&nbsp; Extremes
of unimportance cannot hurt us, therefore we are well disposed towards
them; the means may come to do so, therefore we do not love them.&nbsp;
Hence we pick a fly out of a milk-jug and watch with pleasure over its
recovery, for we are confident that under no conceivable circumstances
will it want to borrow money from us; but we feel less sure about a
mouse, so we show it no quarter.&nbsp; The compilers of our almanacs
well know this tendency of our natures, so they tell us, not when Noah
went into the ark, nor when the temple of Jerusalem was dedicated, but
that Lindley Murray, grammarian, died January 16th, 1826.&nbsp; This
is not because they could not find so many as three hundred and sixty-five
events of considerable interest since the creation of the world, but
because they well know we would rather hear of something less interesting.&nbsp;
We care most about what concerns us either very closely, or so little
that practically we have nothing whatever to do with it.</p>
<p>I once asked a young Italian, who professed to have a considerable
knowledge of English literature, which of all our poems pleased him
best.&nbsp; He replied without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cow jumped over the moon;<br />
The little dog laughed to see such sport,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the dish ran away with the spoon.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He said this was better than anything in Italian.&nbsp; They had
Dante and Tasso, and ever so many more great poets, but they had nothing
comparable to &ldquo;Hey diddle diddle,&rdquo; nor had he been able
to conceive how anyone could have written it.&nbsp; Did I know the author&rsquo;s
name, and had we given him a statue?&nbsp; On this I told him of the
young lady of Harrow who would go to church in a barrow, and plied him
with whatever rhyming nonsense I could call to mind, but it was no use;
all of these things had an element of reality that robbed them of half
their charm, whereas &ldquo;Hey diddle diddle&rdquo; had nothing in
it that could conceivably concern him.</p>
<p>So again it is with the things that gall us most.&nbsp; What is it
that rises up against us at odd times and smites us in the face again
and again for years after it has happened?&nbsp; That we spent all the
best years of our life in learning what we have found to be a swindle,
and to have been known to be a swindle by those who took money for misleading
us?&nbsp; That those on whom we most leaned most betrayed us?&nbsp;
That we have only come to feel our strength when there is little strength
left of any kind to feel?&nbsp; These things will hardly much disturb
a man of ordinary good temper.&nbsp; But that he should have said this
or that little unkind and wanton saying; that he should have gone away
from this or that hotel and given a shilling too little to the waiter;
that his clothes were shabby at such or such a garden-party&mdash;these
things gall us <i>as</i> a corn will sometimes do, though the loss of
a limb may not be seriously felt.</p>
<p>I have been reminded lately of these considerations with more than
common force by reading the very voluminous correspondence left by my
grandfather, Dr. Butler, of Shrewsbury, whose memoirs I am engaged in
writing.&nbsp; I have found a large number of interesting letters on
subjects of serious import, but must confess that it is to the hardly
less numerous lighter letters that I have been most attracted, nor do
I feel sure that my eminent namesake did not share my predilection.&nbsp;
Among other letters in my possession I have one bundle that has been
kept apart, and has evidently no connection with Dr. Butler&rsquo;s
own life.&nbsp; I cannot use these letters, therefore, for my book,
but over and above the charm of their inspired spelling, I find them
of such an extremely trivial nature that I incline to hope the reader
may derive as much amusement from them as I have done myself, and venture
to give them the publicity here which I must refuse them in my book.&nbsp;
The dates and signatures have, with the exception of Mrs. Newton&rsquo;s,
been carefully erased, but I have collected that they were written by
the two servants of a single lady who resided at no great distance from
London, to two nieces of the said lady who lived in London itself.&nbsp;
The aunt never writes, but always gets one of the servants to do so
for her.&nbsp; She appears either as &ldquo;your aunt&rdquo; or as &ldquo;She&rdquo;;
her name is not given, but she is evidently looked upon with a good
deal of awe by all who had to do with her.</p>
<p>The letters almost all of them relate to visits either of the aunt
to London, or of the nieces to the aunt&rsquo;s home, which, from occasional
allusions to hopping, I gather to have been in Kent, Sussex, or Surrey.&nbsp;
I have arranged them to the best of my power, and take the following
to be the earliest.&nbsp; It has no signature, but is not in the handwriting
of the servant who styles herself Elizabeth, or Mrs. Newton.&nbsp; It
runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;MADAM,&mdash;Your Aunt Wishes me to inform you
she will be glad if you will let hir know if you think of coming To
hir House thiss month or Next as she cannot have you in September on
a kount of the Hoping If you ar coming she thinkes she had batter Go

Thing raddy for you at hir House and Mrs. Newton to meet you and stay
with you till She returnes a gann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;if you arnot Coming thiss Summer She will be in London before

more thann two nits. and She Says she willnot truble you on anny a kount

<p>&ldquo;Charles is a butty and so good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr &amp; Mrs Newton ar quite wall &amp; desires to be remembered
to you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can throw no light on the meaning of the verb to &ldquo;beslive.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Each letter in the MS. is so admirably formed that there can be no question
about the word being as I have given it.&nbsp; Nor have I been able
to discover what is referred to by the words &ldquo;Charles is a butty
and so good.&rdquo;&nbsp; We shall presently meet with a Charles who
&ldquo;flies in the Fier,&rdquo; but that Charles appears to have been
in London, whereas this one is evidently in Kent, or wherever the aunt
lived.</p>
<p>The next letter is from Mrs. Newton:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;DER MISS ---, I Receve your Letter your Aunt is
vary Ill and Lowspireted I Donte think your Aunt wood Git up all Day
if My Sister Wasnot to Persage her We all Think hir lif is two monopolous.

But vary Littel indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Happy to Say We are Both Quite Well and I am Glad no
hear you are Both Quite Well</p>
<p>&ldquo;MRS NEWTON.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to have made the nieces propose to pay a visit to their
aunt, perhaps to try and relieve the monopoly of her existence and cheer
her up a little.&nbsp; In their letter, doubtless, the dog motive is
introduced that is so finely developed presently by Mrs. Newton.&nbsp;
I should like to have been able to give the theme as enounced by the
nieces themselves, but their letters are not before me.&nbsp; Mrs. Newton
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;MY DEAR GIRLS,&mdash;Your Aunt receiv your Letter
your Aunt will Be vary glad to see you as it quite a greeable if it
tis to you and Shee is Quite Willing to Eair the beds and the Rooms
if you Like to Trust to hir and the Servantes; if not I may Go up there
as you Wish.&nbsp; My Sister Sleeps in the Best Room as she allways
Did and the Coock in the garret and you Can have the Rooms the same
as you allways Did as your Aunt Donte set in the Parlour She Continlery
Sets in the Ciching. your Aunt says she Cannot Part from the dog know
hows and She Says he will not hurt you for he is Like a Child and I
can safeley say My Self he wonte hurt you as She Cannot Sleep in the
Room With out him as he allWay Sleep in the Same Room as She Dose.&nbsp;
your Aunt is agreeable to Git in What Coles and Wood you Wish for I
am know happy to say your Aunt is in as Good health as ever She Was
and She is happy to hear you are Both Well your Aunt Wishes for Ancer
By Return of Post.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nieces replied that their aunt must choose between the dog and
them, and Mrs. Newton sends a second letter which brings her development
to a climax.&nbsp; It runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;DEAR MISS --- I have Receve your Letter and i
Whent up to your Aunt as you Wish me and i Try to Perveal With her about
the Dog But she Wold not Put the Dog away nor it alow him to Be Tied
up But She Still Wishes you to Come as Shee says the Dog Shall not interrup
you for She Donte alow the Dog nor it the Cats to Go in the Parlour
never sence She has had it Donup ferfere of Spoiling the Paint your

and She says you Cant Go out in London But What you are up a gance one
and She says She Wonte Trust the Dog in know one hands But her Owne

<p>&ldquo;I Still Remane your Humble Servant Mrs Newton</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am vary sorry to think the Dog Perventes your Comeing</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Glad to hear you are Both Well and we are the same.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nieces remained firm, and from the following letter it is plain
the aunt gave way.&nbsp; The dog motive is repeated <i>pianissimo</i>,
and is not returned to&mdash;not at least by Mrs. Newton.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;DEAR MISS ---, I Receve your Letter on Thursday
i Whent to your Aunt and i see her and She is a Greable to everry thing
i asked her and seme so vary Much Please to see you Both Next Tuseday
and she has sent for the Faggots to Day and she Will Send for the Coles
to Morrow and i will Go up there to Morrow Morning and Make the Fiers
and Tend to the Beds and sleep in it Till you Come Down your Aunt sends
her Love to you Both and she is Quite well your Aunt Wishes you wold
Write againe Before you Come as she ma Expeckye and the Dog is not to
Gointo the Parlor a Tall</p>
<p>&ldquo;your Aunt kind Love to you Both &amp; hopes you Wonte Fail
in Coming according to Prommis</p>
<p>&ldquo;MRS NEWTON.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a later letter it appears that the nieces did not pay their
visit after all, and what is worse a letter had miscarried, and the
aunt sat up expecting them from seven till twelve at night, and Harry
had paid for &ldquo;Faggots and Coles quarter of Hund.&nbsp; Faggots
Half tun of Coles 1<i>l</i>. 1s. 3<i>d</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly afterwards,
however, &ldquo;She&rdquo; again talks of coming up to London herself
and writes through her servant:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My Dear girls i Receve your kind letter &amp;
I am happy to hear you ar both Well and I Was in hopes of seeing of
you Both Down at My House this spring to stay a Wile I am Quite well
my self in Helth But vary Low Spireted I am vary sorry to hear the Misforting
of Poor charles &amp; how he cum to flie in the Fier I cannot think.&nbsp;
I should like to know if he is dead or a Live, and I shall come to London
in August &amp; stay three or four daies if it is agreable to you.&nbsp;
Mrs. Newton has lost her mother in Law 4 day March &amp; I hope you
send me word Wather charles is Dead or a Live as soon as possible, and
will you send me word what Little Betty is for I cannot make her out.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next letter is a new handwriting, and tells the nieces of their
aunt&rsquo;s death in the following terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;DEAR MISS ---, It is my most painful duty to inform
you that your dear aunt expired this morning comparatively easy as Hannah
informs me and in so doing restored her soul to the custody of him whom
she considered to be alone worthy of its care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor had visited her about five minutes previously and
had applied a blister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your sister will I am sure excuse further details
at present and believe me with kindest remembrances to remain</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours truly, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a few days a lawyer&rsquo;s letter informs the nieces that
their aunt had left them the bulk of her not very considerable property,
but had charged them with an annuity of &pound;1 a week to be paid to
Harry and Mrs. Newton so long as the dog lived.</p>
<p>The only other letters by Mrs. Newton are written on paper of a different
and more modern size; they leave an impression of having been written
a good many years later.&nbsp; I take them as they come.&nbsp; The first
is very short:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;DEAR MISS ---, i write to say i cannot possiblely
come on Wednesday as we have killed a pig. your&rsquo;s truely,</p>
<p>&ldquo;ELIZABETH NEWTON.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;DEAR MISS ---, i hope you are both quite well
in health &amp; your Leg much better i am happy to say i am getting
quite well again i hope Amandy has reached you safe by this time i sent
a small parcle by Amandy, there was half a dozen Pats of butter &amp;
the Cakes was very homely and not so light as i could wish i hope by
this time Sarah Ann has promised she will stay untill next monday as
i think a few daies longer will not make much diferance and as her young
man has been very considerate to wait so long as he has i think he would
for a few days Longer dear Miss --- I wash for William and i have not
got his clothes yet as it has been delayed by the carrier &amp; i cannot
possiblely get it done before Sunday and i do not Like traviling on
a Sunday but to oblige you i would come but to come sooner i cannot
possiblely but i hope Sarah Ann will be prevailed on once more as She
has so many times i feel sure if she tells her young man he will have
patient for he is a very kind young man</p>
<p>&ldquo;i remain your sincerely</p>
<p>&ldquo;ELIZABETH NEWTON.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last letter in my collection seems written almost within measurable
distance of the Christmas-card era.&nbsp; The sheet is headed by a beautifully
embossed device of some holly in red and green, wishing the recipient
of the letter a merry Xmas and a happy new year, while the border is
crimped and edged with blue.&nbsp; I know not what it is, but there
is something in the writer&rsquo;s highly finished style that reminds
me of Mendelssohn.&nbsp; It would almost do for the words of one of
his celebrated &ldquo;Lieder ohne Worte&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;DEAR MISS MARIA,&mdash;I hasten to acknowledge
the receipt of your kind note with the inclosure for which I return
my best thanks.&nbsp; I need scarcely say how glad I was to know that
the volumes secured your approval, and that the announcement of the
improvement in the condition of your Sister&rsquo;s legs afforded me
infinite pleasure.&nbsp; The gratifying news encouraged me in the hope
that now the nature of the disorder is comprehended her legs will&mdash;notwithstanding
the process may be gradual&mdash;ultimately get quite well.&nbsp; The
pretty Robin Redbreast which lay ensconced in your epistle, conveyed
to me, in terms more eloquent than words, how much you desired me those
Compliments which the little missive he bore in his bill expressed;
the emblem is sweetly pretty, and now that we are again allowed to felicitate
each other on another recurrence of the season of the Christian&rsquo;s
rejoicing, permit me to tender to yourself, and by you to your Sister,
mine and my Wife&rsquo;s heartfelt congratulations and warmest wishes
with respect to the coming year.&nbsp; It is a common belief that if
we take a retrospective view of each departing year, as it behoves us
annually to do, we shall find the blessings which we have received to
immeasurably outnumber our causes of sorrow.&nbsp; Speaking for myself
I can fully subscribe to that sentiment, and doubtless neither Miss
--- nor yourself are exceptions.&nbsp; Miss ---&rsquo;s illness and
consequent confinement to the house has been a severe trial, but in
that trouble an opportunity was afforded you to prove a Sister&rsquo;s
devotion and she has been enabled to realise a larger (if possible)
display of sisterly affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A happy Christmas to you both, and may the new year prove
a Cornucopia from which still greater blessings than even those we have
hitherto received, shall issue, to benefit us all by contributing to
our temporal happiness and, what is of higher importance, conducing
to our felicity hereafter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry to hear that you were so annoyed with mice and
rats, and if I should have an opportunity to obtain a nice cat I will
do so and send my boy to your house with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remain,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours truly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How little what is commonly called education can do after all towards
the formation of a good style, and what a delightful volume might not
be entitled &ldquo;Half Hours with the Worst Authors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why,
the finest word I know of in the English language was coined, not by
my poor old grandfather, whose education had left little to desire,
nor by any of the admirable scholars whom he in his turn educated, but
by an old matron who presided over one of the halls, or houses of his
school.&nbsp; This good lady, whose name by the way was Bromfield, had
a fine high temper of her own, or thought it politic to affect one.&nbsp;
One night when the boys were particularly noisy she burst like a hurricane
into the hall, collared a youngster, and told him he was the &ldquo;rampingest-scampingest-rackety-tackety-tow-row-roaringest
boy in the whole school.&rdquo;&nbsp; Would Mrs. Newton have been able
to set the aunt and the dog before us so vividly if she had been more
highly educated?&nbsp; Would Mrs. Bromfield have been able to forge
and hurl her thunderbolt of a word if she had been taught how to do
so, or indeed been at much pains to create it at all?&nbsp; It came.&nbsp;
It was her &chi;&alpha;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&mu;&alpha;.&nbsp; She did
not probably know that she had done what the greatest scholar would
have had to rack his brains over for many an hour before he could even
approach.&nbsp; Tradition says that having brought down her boy she
looked round the hall in triumph, and then after a moment&rsquo;s lull
said, &ldquo;Young gentlemen, prayers are excused,&rdquo; and left them.</p>
<p>I have sometimes thought that, after all, the main use of a classical
education consists in the check it gives to originality, and the way
in which it prevents an inconvenient number of people from using their
own eyes.&nbsp; That we will not be at the trouble of looking at things
for ourselves if we can get anyone to tell us what we ought to see goes
without saying, and it is the business of schools and universities to
assist us in this respect.&nbsp; The theory of evolution teaches that
any power not worked at pretty high pressure will deteriorate: originality
and freedom from affectation are all very well in their way, but we
can easily have too much of them, and it is better that none should
be either original or free from cant but those who insist on being so,
no matter what hindrances obstruct, nor what incentives are offered
them to see things through the regulation medium.&nbsp; To insist on
seeing things for oneself is to be an &iota;&delta;&iota;&omega;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;,
or in plain English, an idiot; nor do I see any safer check against
general vigour and clearness of thought, with consequent terseness of
expression, than that provided by the curricula of our universities
and schools of public instruction.&nbsp; If a young man, in spite of
every effort to fit him with blinkers, will insist on getting rid of
them, he must do so at his own risk.&nbsp; He will not be long in finding
out his mistake.&nbsp; Our public schools and universities play the
beneficent part in our social scheme that cattle do in forests: they
browse the seedlings down and prevent the growth of all but the luckiest
and sturdiest.&nbsp; Of course, if there are too many either cattle
or schools, they browse so effectually that they find no more food,
and starve till equilibrium is restored; but it seems to be a provision
of nature that there should always be these alternate periods, during
which either the cattle or the trees are getting the best of it; and,
indeed, without such provision we should have neither the one nor the
other.&nbsp; At this moment the cattle, doubtless, are in the ascendant,
and if university extension proceeds much farther, we shall assuredly
have no more Mrs. Newtons and Mrs. Bromfields; but whatever is is best,
and, on the whole, I should propose to let things find pretty much their
own level.</p>
<p>However this may be, who can question that the treasures hidden in
many a country house contain sleeping beauties even fairer than those
that I have endeavoured to waken from long sleep in the foregoing article?&nbsp;
How many Mrs. Quicklys are there not living in London at this present
moment?&nbsp; For that Mrs. Quickly was an invention of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
I will not believe.&nbsp; The old woman from whom he drew said every
word that he put into Mrs. Quickly&rsquo;s mouth, and a great deal more
which he did not and perhaps could not make use of.&nbsp; This question,
however, would again lead me far from my subject, which I should mar
were I to dwell upon it longer, and therefore leave with the hope that
it may give my readers absolutely no food whatever for reflection.</p>
<h2>How to Make the Best of Life <a name="citation142"></a><a href="#footnote142">{142}</a></h2>
<p>I have been asked to speak on the question how to make the best of
life, but may as well confess at once that I know nothing about it.&nbsp;
I cannot think that I have made the best of my own life, nor is it likely
that I shall make much better of what may or may not remain to me.&nbsp;
I do not even know how to make the best of the twenty minutes that your
committee has placed at my disposal, and as for life as a whole, who
ever yet made the best of such a colossal opportunity by conscious effort
and deliberation?&nbsp; In little things no doubt deliberate and conscious
effort will help us, but we are speaking of large issues, and such kingdoms
of heaven as the making the best of these come not by observation.</p>
<p>The question, therefore, on which I have undertaken to address you
is, as you must all know, fatuous, if it be faced seriously.&nbsp; Life
is like playing a violin solo in public and learning the instrument
as one goes on.&nbsp; One cannot make the best of such impossibilities,
and the question is doubly fatuous until we are told which of our two
lives&mdash;the conscious or the unconscious&mdash;is held by the asker
to be the truer life.&nbsp; Which does the question contemplate&mdash;the
life we know, or the life which others may know, but which we know not?</p>
<p>Death gives a life to some men and women compared with which their
so-called existence here is as nothing.&nbsp; Which is the truer life
of Shakespeare, Handel, that divine woman who wrote the <i>Odyssey</i>,
and of Jane Austen&mdash;the life which palpitated with sensible warm
motion within their own bodies, or that in virtue of which they are
still palpitating in ours?&nbsp; In whose consciousness does their truest
life consist&mdash;their own, or ours?&nbsp; Can Shakespeare be said
to have begun his true life till a hundred years or so after he was
dead and buried?&nbsp; His physical life was but as an embryonic stage,
a coming up out of darkness, a twilight and dawn before the sunrise
of that life of the world to come which he was to enjoy hereafter.&nbsp;
We all live for a while after we are gone hence, but we are for the
most part stillborn, or at any rate die in infancy, as regards that
life which every age and country has recognized as higher and truer
than the one of which we are now sentient.&nbsp; As the life of the
race is larger, longer, and in all respects more to be considered than
that of the individual, so is the life we live in others larger and
more important than the one we live in ourselves.&nbsp; This appears
nowhere perhaps more plainly than in the case of great teachers, who
often in the lives of their pupils produce an effect that reaches far
beyond anything produced while their single lives were yet unsupplemented
by those other lives into which they infused their own.</p>
<p>Death to such people is the ending of a short life, but it does not
touch the life they are already living in those whom they have taught;
and happily, as none can know when he shall die, so none can make sure
that he too shall not live long beyond the grave; for the life after
death is like money before it&mdash;no one can be sure that it may not
fall to him or her even at the eleventh hour.&nbsp; Money and immortality
come in such odd unaccountable ways that no one is cut off from hope.&nbsp;
We may not have made either of them for ourselves, but yet another may
give them to us in virtue of his or her love, which shall illumine us
for ever, and establish us in some heavenly mansion whereof we neither
dreamed nor shall ever dream.&nbsp; Look at the Doge Loredano Loredani,
the old man&rsquo;s smile upon whose face has been reproduced so faithfully
in so many lands that it can never henceforth be forgotten&mdash;would
he have had one hundredth part of the life he now lives had he not been
linked awhile with one of those heaven-sent men who know <i>che cosa
&egrave; amor</i>?&nbsp; Look at Rembrandt&rsquo;s old woman in our
National Gallery; had she died before she was eighty-three years old
she would not have been living now.&nbsp; Then, when she was eighty-three,
immortality perched upon her as a bird on a withered bough.</p>
<p>I seem to hear someone say that this is a mockery, a piece of special
pleading, a giving of stones to those that ask for bread.&nbsp; Life
is not life unless we can feel it, and a life limited to a knowledge
of such fraction of our work as may happen to survive us is no true
life in other people; salve it as we may, death is not life any more
than black is white.</p>
<p>The objection is not so true as it sounds.&nbsp; I do not deny that
we had rather not die, nor do I pretend that much even in the case of
the most favoured few can survive them beyond the grave.&nbsp; It is
only because this is so that our own life is possible; others have made
room for us, and we should make room for others in our turn without
undue repining.&nbsp; What I maintain is that a not inconsiderable number
of people do actually attain to a life beyond the grave which we can
all feel forcibly enough, whether they can do so or not&mdash;that this
life tends with increasing civilization to become more and more potent,
and that it is better worth considering, in spite of its being unfelt
by ourselves, than any which we have felt or can ever feel in our own
persons.</p>
<p>Take an extreme case.&nbsp; A group of people are photographed by
Edison&rsquo;s new process&mdash;say Titiens, Trebelli, and Jenny Lind,
with any two of the finest men singers the age has known&mdash;let them
be photographed incessantly for half an hour while they perform a scene
in <i>Lohengrin</i>; let all be done stereoscopically.&nbsp; Let them
be phonographed at the same time so that their minutest shades of intonation
are preserved, let the slides be coloured by a competent artist, and
then let the scene be called suddenly into sight and sound, say a hundred
years hence.&nbsp; Are those people dead or alive?&nbsp; Dead to themselves
they are, but while they live so powerfully and so livingly in us, which
is the greater paradox&mdash;to say that they are alive or that they
are dead?&nbsp; To myself it seems that their life in others would be
more truly life than their death to themselves is death.&nbsp; Granted
that they do not present all the phenomena of life&mdash;who ever does
so even when he is held to be alive?&nbsp; We are held to be alive because
we present a sufficient number of living phenomena to let the others
go without saying; those who see us take the part for the whole here
as in everything else, and surely, in the case supposed above, the phenomena
of life predominate so powerfully over those of death, that the people
themselves must be held to be more alive than dead.&nbsp; Our living
personality is, as the word implies, only our mask, and those who still
own such a mask as I have supposed have a living personality.&nbsp;
Granted again that the case just put is an extreme one; still many a
man and many a woman has so stamped him or herself on his work that,
though we would gladly have the aid of such accessories as we doubtless
presently shall have to the livingness of our great dead, we can see
them very sufficiently through the masterpieces they have left us.</p>
<p>As for their own unconsciousness I do not deny it.&nbsp; The life
of the embryo was unconscious before birth, and so is the life&mdash;I
am speaking only of the life revealed to us by natural religion&mdash;after
death.&nbsp; But as the embryonic and infant life of which we were unconscious
was the most potent factor in our after life of consciousness, so the
effect which we may unconsciously produce in others after death, and
it may be even before it on those who have never seen us, is in all
sober seriousness our truer and more abiding life, and the one which
those who would make the best of their sojourn here will take most into
their consideration.</p>
<p>Unconsciousness is no bar to livingness.&nbsp; Our conscious actions
are a drop in the sea as compared with our unconscious ones.&nbsp; Could
we know all the life that is in us by way of circulation, nutrition,
breathing, waste and repair, we should learn what an infinitesimally
small part consciousness plays in our present existence; yet our unconscious
life is as truly life as our conscious life, and though it is unconscious
to itself it emerges into an indirect and vicarious consciousness in
our other and conscious self, which exists but in virtue of our unconscious
self.&nbsp; So we have also a vicarious consciousness in others.&nbsp;
The unconscious life of those that have gone before us has in great
part moulded us into such men and women as we are, and our own unconscious
lives will in like manner have a vicarious consciousness in others,
though we be dead enough to it in ourselves.</p>
<p>If it is again urged that it matters not to us how much we may be
alive in others, if we are to know nothing about it, I reply that the
common instinct of all who are worth considering gives the lie to such
cynicism.&nbsp; I see here present some who have achieved, and others
who no doubt will achieve, success in literature.&nbsp; Will one of
them hesitate to admit that it is a lively pleasure to her to feel that
on the other side of the world someone may be smiling happily over her
work, and that she is thus living in that person though she knows nothing
about it?&nbsp; Here it seems to me that true faith comes in.&nbsp;
Faith does not consist, as the Sunday School pupil said, &ldquo;in the
power of believing that which we know to be untrue.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
consists in holding fast that which the healthiest and most kindly instincts
of the best and most sensible men and women are intuitively possessed
of, without caring to require much evidence further than the fact that
such people are so convinced; and for my own part I find the best men
and women I know unanimous in feeling that life in others, even though
we know nothing about it, is nevertheless a thing to be desired and
gratefully accepted if we can get it either before death or after.&nbsp;
I observe also that a large number of men and women do actually attain
to such life, and in some cases continue so to live, if not for ever,
yet to what is practically much the same thing.&nbsp; Our life then
in this world is, to natural religion as much as to revealed, a period
of probation.&nbsp; The use we make of it is to settle how far we are
to enter into another, and whether that other is to be a heaven of just
affection or a hell of righteous condemnation.</p>
<p>Who, then, are the most likely so to run that they may obtain this
veritable prize of our high calling?&nbsp; Setting aside such lucky
numbers, drawn as it were in the lottery of immortality, which I have
referred to casually above, and setting aside also the chances and changes
from which even immortality is not exempt, who on the whole are most
likely to live anew in the affectionate thoughts of those who never
so much as saw them in the flesh, and know not even their names?&nbsp;
There is a <i>nisus</i>, a straining in the dull dumb economy of things,
in virtue of which some, whether they will it and know it or no, are
more likely to live after death than others, and who are these?&nbsp;
Those who aimed at it as by some great thing that they would do to make
them famous?&nbsp; Those who have lived most in themselves and for themselves,
or those who have been most ensouled consciously, but perhaps better
unconsciously, directly but more often indirectly, by the most living
souls past and present that have flitted near them?&nbsp; Can we think
of a man or woman who grips us firmly, at the thought of whom we kindle
when we are alone in our honest daw&rsquo;s plumes, with none to admire
or shrug his shoulders, can we think of one such, the secret of whose
power does not lie in the charm of his or her personality&mdash;that
is to say, in the wideness of his or her sympathy with, and therefore
life in and communion with other people?&nbsp; In the wreckage that
comes ashore from the sea of time there is much tinsel stuff that we
must preserve and study if we would know our own times and people; granted
that many a dead charlatan lives long and enters largely and necessarily
into our own lives; we use them and throw them away when we have done
with them.&nbsp; I do not speak of these, I do not speak of the Virgils
and Alexander Popes, and who can say how many more whose names I dare
not mention for fear of offending.&nbsp; They are as stuffed birds or
beasts in a museum; serviceable no doubt from a scientific standpoint,
but with no vivid or vivifying hold upon us.&nbsp; They seem to be alive,
but are not.&nbsp; I am speaking of those who do actually live in us,
and move us to higher achievements though they be long dead, whose life
thrusts out our own and overrides it.&nbsp; I speak of those who draw
us ever more towards them from youth to age, and to think of whom is
to feel at once that we are in the hands of those we love, and whom
we would most wish to resemble.&nbsp; What is the secret of the hold
that these people have upon us?&nbsp; Is it not that while, conventionally
speaking, alive, they most merged their lives in, and were in fullest
communion with those among whom they lived?&nbsp; They found their lives
in losing them.&nbsp; We never love the memory of anyone unless we feel
that he or she was himself or herself a lover.</p>
<p>I have seen it urged, again, in querulous accents, that the so-called
immortality even of the most immortal is not for ever.&nbsp; I see a
passage to this effect in a book that is making a stir as I write.&nbsp;
I will quote it.&nbsp; The writer says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So, it seems to me, is the immortality we so glibly
predicate of departed artists.&nbsp; If they survive at all, it is but
a shadowy life they live, moving on through the gradations of slow decay
to distant but inevitable death.&nbsp; They can no longer, as heretofore,
speak directly to the hearts of their fellow-men, evoking their tears
or laughter, and all the pleasures, be they sad or merry, of which imagination
holds the secret.&nbsp; Driven from the market-place they become first
the companions of the student, then the victims of the specialist.&nbsp;
He who would still hold familiar intercourse with them must train himself
to penetrate the veil which in ever-thickening folds conceals them from
the ordinary gaze; he must catch the tone of a vanished society, he
must move in a circle of alien associations, he must think in a language
not his own.&rdquo; <a name="citation150"></a><a href="#footnote150">{150}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is crying for the moon, or rather pretending to cry for it,
for the writer is obviously insincere.&nbsp; I see the <i>Saturday Review</i>
says the passage I have just quoted &ldquo;reaches almost to poetry,&rdquo;
and indeed I find many blank verses in it, some of them very aggressive.&nbsp;
No prose is free from an occasional blank verse, and a good writer will
not go hunting over his work to rout them out, but nine or ten in little
more than as many lines is indeed reaching too near to poetry for good
prose.&nbsp; This, however, is a trifle, and might pass if the tone
of the writer was not so obviously that of cheap pessimism.&nbsp; I
know not which is cheapest, pessimism or optimism.&nbsp; One forces
lights, the other darks; both are equally untrue to good art, and equally
sure of their effect with the groundlings.&nbsp; The one extenuates,
the other sets down in malice.&nbsp; The first is the more amiable lie,
but both are lies, and are known to be so by those who utter them.&nbsp;
Talk about catching the tone of a vanished society to understand Rembrandt
or Giovanni Bellini!&nbsp; It is nonsense&mdash;the folds do not thicken
in front of these men; we understand them as well as those among whom
they went about in the flesh, and perhaps better.&nbsp; Homer and Shakespeare
speak to us probably far more effectually than they did to the men of
their own time, and most likely we have them at their best.&nbsp; I
cannot think that Shakespeare talked better than we hear him now in
<i>Hamlet</i> or <i>Henry the Fourth</i>; like enough he would have
been found a very disappointing person in a drawing-room.&nbsp; People
stamp themselves on their work; if they have not done so they are naught,
if they have we have them; and for the most part they stamp themselves
deeper on their work than on their talk.&nbsp; No doubt Shakespeare
and Handel will be one day clean forgotten, as though they had never
been born.&nbsp; The world will in the end die; mortality therefore
itself is not immortal, and when death dies the life of these men will
die with it&mdash;but not sooner.&nbsp; It is enough that they should
live within us and move us for many ages as they have and will.&nbsp;
Such immortality, therefore, as some men and women are born to achieve,
or have thrust upon them, is a practical if not a technical immortality,
and he who would have more let him have nothing.</p>
<p>I see I have drifted into speaking rather of how to make the best
of death than of life, but who can speak of life without his thoughts
turning instantly to that which is beyond it?&nbsp; He or she who has
made the best of the life after death has made the best of the life
before it; who cares one straw for any such chances and changes as will
commonly befall him here if he is upheld by the full and certain hope
of everlasting life in the affections of those that shall come after?&nbsp;
If the life after death is happy in the hearts of others, it matters
little how unhappy was the life before it.</p>
<p>And now I leave my subject, not without misgiving that I shall have
disappointed you.&nbsp; But for the great attention which is being paid
to the work from which I have quoted above, I should not have thought
it well to insist on points with which you are, I doubt not, as fully
impressed as I am: but that book weakens the sanctions of natural religion,
and minimizes the comfort which it affords us, while it does more to
undermine than to support the foundations of what is commonly called
belief.&nbsp; Therefore I was glad to embrace this opportunity of protesting.&nbsp;
Otherwise I should not have been so serious on a matter that transcends
all seriousness.&nbsp; Lord Beaconsfield cut it shorter with more effect.&nbsp;
When asked to give a rule of life for the son of a friend he said, &ldquo;Do
not let him try and find out who wrote the letters of Junius.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Pressed for further counsel, he added, &ldquo;Nor yet who was the man
in the iron mask&rdquo;&mdash;and he would say no more.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
bore people.&nbsp; And yet I am by no means sure that a good many people
do not think themselves ill-used unless he who addresses them has thoroughly
well bored them&mdash;especially if they have paid any money for hearing
him.&nbsp; My great namesake said, &ldquo;Surely the pleasure is as
great of being cheated as to cheat,&rdquo; and great as the pleasure
both of cheating and boring undoubtedly is, I believe he was right.&nbsp;
So I remember a poem which came out some thirty years ago in <i>Punch</i>,
about a young lady who went forth in quest to &ldquo;Some burden make
or burden bear, but which she did not greatly care, oh Miserie.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So, again, all the holy men and women who in the Middle Ages professed
to have discovered how to make the best of life took care that being
bored, if not cheated, should have a large place in their programme.&nbsp;
Still there are limits, and I close not without fear that I may have
exceeded them.</p>
<h2>The Sanctuary of Montrigone <a name="citation153a"></a><a href="#footnote153a">{153a}</a></h2>
<p>The only place in the Valsesia, except Varallo, where I at present
suspect the presence of Tabachetti <a name="citation153b"></a><a href="#footnote153b">{153b}</a>
is at Montrigone, a little-known sanctuary dedicated to St. Anne, about
three-quarters of a mile south of Borgo-Sesia station.&nbsp; The situation
is, of course, lovely, but the sanctuary does not offer any features
of architectural interest.&nbsp; The sacristan told me it was founded
in 1631; and in 1644 Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico, while engaged in superintending
and completing the work undertaken here by himself and Giacomo Ferro,
fell ill and died.&nbsp; I do not know whether or no there was an earlier
sanctuary on the same site, but was told it was built on the demolition
of a stronghold belonging to the Counts of Biandrate.</p>
<p>The incidents which it illustrates are treated with even more than
the homeliness usual in works of this description when not dealing with
such solemn events as the death and passion of Christ.&nbsp; Except
when these subjects were being represented, something of the latitude,
and even humour, allowed in the old mystery plays was permitted, doubtless
from a desire to render the work more attractive to the peasants, who
were the most numerous and most important pilgrims.&nbsp; It is not
until faith begins to be weak that it fears an occasionally lighter
treatment of semi-sacred subjects, and it is impossible to convey an
accurate idea of the spirit prevailing at this hamlet of sanctuary without
attuning oneself somewhat to the more pagan character of the place.&nbsp;
Of irreverence, in the sense of a desire to laugh at things that are
of high and serious import, there is not a trace, but at the same time
there is a certain unbending of the bow at Montrigone which is not perceivable
at Varallo.</p>
<p>The first chapel to the left on entering the church is that of the
Birth of the Virgin.&nbsp; St. Anne is sitting up in bed.&nbsp; She
is not at all ill&mdash;in fact, considering that the Virgin has only
been born about five minutes, she is wonderful; still the doctors think
it may be perhaps better that she should keep her room for half an hour
longer, so the bed has been festooned with red and white paper roses,
and the counterpane is covered with bouquets in baskets and in vases
of glass and china.&nbsp; These cannot have been there during the actual
birth of the Virgin, so I suppose they had been in readiness, and were
brought in from an adjoining room as soon as the baby had been born.&nbsp;
A lady on her left is bringing in some more flowers, which St. Anne
is receiving with a smile and most gracious gesture of the hands.&nbsp;
The first thing she asked for, when the birth was over, was for her
three silver hearts.&nbsp; These were immediately brought to her, and
she has got them all on, tied round her neck with a piece of blue silk
ribbon.</p>
<p>Dear mamma has come.&nbsp; We felt sure she would, and that any little
misunderstandings between her and Joachim would ere long be forgotten
and forgiven.&nbsp; They are both so good and sensible, if they would
only understand one another.&nbsp; At any rate, here she is, in high
state at the right hand of the bed.&nbsp; She is dressed in black, for
she has lost her husband some few years previously, but I do not believe
a smarter, sprier old lady for her years could be found in Palestine,
nor yet that either Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico or Giacomo Ferro could have
conceived or executed such a character.&nbsp; The sacristan wanted to
have it that she was not a woman at all, but was a portrait of St. Joachim,
the Virgin&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sembra una donna,&rdquo; he
pleaded more than once, &ldquo;ma non &egrave; donna.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely,
however, in works of art even more than in other things, there is no
&ldquo;is&rdquo; but seeming, and if a figure seems female it must be
taken as such.&nbsp; Besides, I asked one of the leading doctors at
Varallo whether the figure was man or woman.&nbsp; He said it was evident
I was not married, for that if I had been I should have seen at once
that she was not only a woman but a mother-in-law of the first magnitude,
or, as he called it, &ldquo;una suocera tremenda,&rdquo; and this without
knowing that I wanted her to be a mother-in-law myself.&nbsp; Unfortunately
she had no real drapery, so I could not settle the question as my friend
Mr. H. F. Jones and I had been able to do at Varallo with the figure
of Eve that had been turned into a Roman soldier assisting at the capture
of Christ.&nbsp; I am not, however, disposed to waste more time upon
anything so obvious, and will content myself with saying that we have
here the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmother.&nbsp; I had never had the pleasure,
so far as I remembered, of meeting this lady before, and was glad to
have an opportunity of making her acquaintance.</p>
<p>Tradition says that it was she who chose the Virgin&rsquo;s name,
and if so, what a debt of gratitude do we not owe her for her judicious
selection!&nbsp; It makes one shudder to think what might have happened
if she had named the child Keren-Happuch, as poor Job&rsquo;s daughter
was called.&nbsp; How could we have said, &ldquo;Ave Keren-Happuch!&rdquo;&nbsp;
What would the musicians have done?&nbsp; I forget whether Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz
was a man or a woman, but there were plenty of names quite as unmanageable
at the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s option, and we cannot sufficiently
thank her for having chosen one that is so euphonious in every language
which we need take into account.&nbsp; For this reason alone we should
not grudge her her portrait, but we should try to draw the line here.&nbsp;
I do not think we ought to give the Virgin&rsquo;s great-grandmother
a statue.&nbsp; Where is it to end?&nbsp; It is like Mr. Crookes&rsquo;s
ultimissimate atoms; we used to draw the line at ultimate atoms, and
now it seems we are to go a step farther back and have ultimissimate
atoms.&nbsp; How long, I wonder, will it be before we feel that it will
be a material help to us to have ultimissimissimate atoms?&nbsp; Quavers
stopped at demi-semi-demi, but there is no reason to suppose that either
atoms or ancestresses of the Virgin will be so complacent.</p>
<p>I have said that on St. Anne&rsquo;s left hand there is a lady who
is bringing in some flowers.&nbsp; St. Anne was always passionately
fond of flowers.&nbsp; There is a pretty story told about her in one
of the Fathers, I forget which, to the effect that when a child she
was asked which she liked best&mdash;cakes or flowers?&nbsp; She could
not yet speak plainly and lisped out, &ldquo;Oh fowses, pretty fowses&rdquo;;
she added, however, with a sigh and as a kind of wistful corollary,
&ldquo;but cakes are very nice.&rdquo;&nbsp; She is not to have any
cakes just now, but as soon as she has done thanking the lady for her
beautiful nosegay, she is to have a couple of nice new-laid eggs, that
are being brought her by another lady.&nbsp; Valsesian women immediately
after their confinement always have eggs beaten up with wine and sugar,
and one can tell a Valsesian Birth of the Virgin from a Venetian or
a Florentine by the presence of the eggs.&nbsp; I learned this from
an eminent Valsesian professor of medicine, who told me that, though
not according to received rules, the eggs never seemed to do any harm.&nbsp;
Here they are evidently to be beaten up, for there is neither spoon
nor egg-cup, and we cannot suppose that they were hard-boiled.&nbsp;
On the other hand, in the Middle Ages Italians never used egg-cups and
spoons for boiled eggs.&nbsp; The medieval boiled egg was always eaten
by dipping bread into the yolk.</p>
<p>Behind the lady who is bringing in the eggs is the under-under-nurse
who is at the fire warming a towel.&nbsp; In the foreground we have
the regulation midwife holding the regulation baby (who, by the way,
was an astonishingly fine child for only five minutes old).&nbsp; Then
comes the under-nurse&mdash;a good buxom creature, who, as usual, is
feeling the water in the bath to see that it is of the right temperature.&nbsp;
Next to her is the head-nurse, who is arranging the cradle.&nbsp; Behind
the head-nurse is the under-under-nurse&rsquo;s drudge, who is just
going out upon some errands.&nbsp; Lastly&mdash;for by this time we
have got all round the chapel&mdash;we arrive at the Virgin&rsquo;s
grandmother&rsquo;s body-guard, a stately, responsible-looking lady,
standing in waiting upon her mistress.&nbsp; I put it to the reader&mdash;is
it conceivable that St. Joachim should have been allowed in such a room
at such a time, or that he should have had the courage to avail himself
of the permission, even though it had been extended to him?&nbsp; At
any rate, is it conceivable that he should have been allowed to sit
on St. Anne&rsquo;s right hand, laying down the law with a &ldquo;Marry,
come up&rdquo; here, and a &ldquo;Marry, go down&rdquo; there, and a
couple of such unabashed collars as the old lady has put on for the
occasion?</p>
<p>Moreover (for I may as well demolish this mischievous confusion between
St. Joachim and his mother-in-law once and for all), the merest tyro
in hagiology knows that St. Joachim was not at home when the Virgin
was born.&nbsp; He had been hustled out of the temple for having no
children, and had fled desolate and dismayed into the wilderness.&nbsp;
It shows how silly people are, for all the time he was going, if they
had only waited a little, to be the father of the most remarkable person
of purely human origin who had ever been born, and such a parent as
this should surely not be hurried.&nbsp; The story is told in the frescoes
of the chapel of Loreto, only a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s walk from
Varallo, and no one can have known it better than D&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp;
The frescoes are explained by written passages that tell us how, when
Joachim was in the desert, an angel came to him in the guise of a fair,
civil young gentleman, and told him the Virgin was to be born.&nbsp;
Then, later on, the same young gentleman appeared to him again, and
bade him &ldquo;in God&rsquo;s name be comforted, and turn again to
his content,&rdquo; for the Virgin had been actually born.&nbsp; On
which St. Joachim, who seems to have been of opinion that marriage after
all <i>was</i> rather a failure, said that, as things were going on
so nicely without him, he would stay in the desert just a little longer,
and offered up a lamb as a pretext to gain time.&nbsp; Perhaps he guessed
about his mother-in-law, or he may have asked the angel.&nbsp; Of course,
even in spite of such evidence as this, I may be mistaken about the
Virgin&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s sex, and the sacristan may be right;
but I can only say that if the lady sitting by St. Anne&rsquo;s bedside
at Montrigone is the Virgin&rsquo;s father&mdash;well, in that case
I must reconsider a good deal that I have been accustomed to believe
was beyond question.</p>
<p>Taken singly, I suppose that none of the figures in the chapel, except
the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmother, should be rated very highly.&nbsp; The
under-nurse is the next best figure, and might very well be Tabachetti&rsquo;s,
for neither Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico nor Giacomo Ferro was successful
with his female characters.&nbsp; There is not a single really comfortable
woman in any chapel by either of them on the Sacro Monte at Varallo.&nbsp;
Tabachetti, on the other hand, delighted in women; if they were young
he made them comely and engaging, if they were old he gave them dignity
and individual character, and the under-nurse is much more in accordance
with Tabachetti&rsquo;s habitual mental attitude than with D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s
or Giacomo Ferro&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Still there are only four figures out
of the eleven that are mere otiose supers, and taking the work as a
whole it leaves a pleasant impression as being throughout na&iuml;ve
and homely, and sometimes, which is of less importance, technically
excellent.</p>
<p>Allowance must, of course, be made for tawdry accessories and repeated
coats of shiny oleaginous paint&mdash;very disagreeable where it has
peeled off and almost more so where it has not.&nbsp; What work could
stand against such treatment as the Valsesian terra-cotta figures have
had to put up with?&nbsp; Take the Venus of Milo; let her be done in
terra-cotta, and have run, not much, but still something, in the baking;
paint her pink, two oils, all over, and then varnish her&mdash;it will
help to preserve the paint; glue a lot of horsehair on to her pate,
half of which shall have come off, leaving the glue still showing; scrape
her, not too thoroughly, get the village drawing-master to paint her
again, and the drawing-master in the next provincial town to put a forest
background behind her with the brightest emerald-green leaves that he
can do for the money; let this painting and scraping and repainting
be repeated several times over; festoon her with pink and white flowers
made of tissue paper; surround her with the cheapest German imitations
of the cheapest decorations that Birmingham can produce; let the night
air and winter fogs get at her for three hundred years, and how easy,
I wonder, will it be to see the goddess who will be still in great part
there?&nbsp; True, in the case of the Birth of the Virgin chapel at
Montrigone, there is no real hair and no fresco background, but time
has had abundant opportunities without these.&nbsp; I will conclude
my notice of this chapel by saying that on the left, above the door
through which the under-under-nurse&rsquo;s drudge is about to pass,
there is a good painted terra-cotta bust, said&mdash;but I believe on
no authority&mdash;to be a portrait of Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp;
Others say that the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmother is Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico,
but this is even more absurd than supposing her to be St. Joachim.</p>
<p>The next chapel to the Birth of the Virgin is that of the <i>Sposalizio</i>.&nbsp;
There is no figure here which suggests Tabachetti, but still there are
some very good ones.&nbsp; The best have no taint of <i>barocco</i>;
the man who did them, whoever he may have been, had evidently a good
deal of life and go, was taking reasonable pains, and did not know too
much.&nbsp; Where this is the case no work can fail to please.&nbsp;
Some of the figures have real hair and some terra-cotta.&nbsp; There
is no fresco background worth mentioning.&nbsp; A man sitting on the
steps of the altar with a book on his lap, and holding up his hand to
another, who is leaning over him and talking to him, is among the best
figures; some of the disappointed suitors who are breaking their wands
are also very good.</p>
<p>The angel in the Annunciation chapel, which comes next in order,
is a fine, burly, ship&rsquo;s-figurehead, commercial-hotel sort of
being enough, but the Virgin is very ordinary.&nbsp; There is no real
hair and no fresco background, only three dingy old blistered pictures
of no interest whatever.</p>
<p>In the Visit of Mary to Elizabeth there are three pleasing subordinate
lady attendants, two to the left and one to the right of the principal
figures; but these figures themselves are not satisfactory.&nbsp; There
is no fresco background.&nbsp; Some of the figures have real hair and
some terra-cotta.</p>
<p>In the Circumcision and Purification chapel&mdash;for both these
events seem contemplated in the one that follows&mdash;there are doves,
but there is neither dog nor knife.&nbsp; Still Simeon, who has the
infant Saviour in his arms, is looking at him in a way which can only
mean that, knife or no knife, the matter is not going to end here.&nbsp;
At Varallo they have now got a dreadful knife for the Circumcision chapel.&nbsp;
They had none last winter.&nbsp; What they have now got would do very
well to kill a bullock with, but could not be used professionally with
safety for any animal smaller than a rhinoceros.&nbsp; I imagine that
someone was sent to Novara to buy a knife, and that, thinking it was
for the Massacre of the Innocents chapel, he got the biggest he could
see.&nbsp; Then when he brought it back people said &ldquo;chow&rdquo;
several times, and put it upon the table and went away.</p>
<p>Returning to Montrigone, the Simeon is an excellent figure, and the
Virgin is fairly good, but the prophetess Anna, who stands just behind
her, is by far the most interesting in the group, and is alone enough
to make me feel sure that Tabachetti gave more or less help here, as
he had done years before at Orta.&nbsp; She, too, like the Virgin&rsquo;s
grandmother, is a widow lady, and wears collars of a cut that seems
to have prevailed ever since the Virgin was born some twenty years previously.&nbsp;
There is a largeness and simplicity of treatment about the figure to
which none but an artist of the highest rank can reach, and D&rsquo;Enrico
was not more than a second or third-rate man.&nbsp; The hood is like
Handel&rsquo;s Truth sailing upon the broad wings of Time, a prophetic
strain that nothing but the old experience of a great poet can reach.&nbsp;
The lips of the prophetess are for the moment closed, but she has been
prophesying all the morning, and the people round the wall in the background
are in ecstasies at the lucidity with which she has explained all sorts
of difficulties that they had never been able to understand till now.&nbsp;
They are putting their forefingers on their thumbs and their thumbs
on their forefingers, and saying how clearly they see it all and what
a wonderful woman Anna is.&nbsp; A prophet indeed is not generally without
honour save in his own country, but then a country is generally not
without honour save with its own prophet, and Anna has been glorifying
her country rather than reviling it.&nbsp; Besides, the rule may not
have applied to prophetesses.</p>
<p>The Death of the Virgin is the last of the six chapels inside the
church itself.&nbsp; The Apostles, who of course are present, have all
of them real hair, but, if I may say so, they want a wash and a brush-up
so very badly that I cannot feel any confidence in writing about them.&nbsp;
I should say that, take them all round, they are a good average sample
of apostle as apostles generally go.&nbsp; Two or three of them are
nervously anxious to find appropriate quotations in books that lie open
before them, which they are searching with eager haste; but I do not
see one figure about which I should like to say positively that it is
either good or bad.&nbsp; There is a good bust of a man, matching the
one in the Birth of the Virgin chapel, which is said to be a portrait
of Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico, but it is not known whom it represents.</p>
<p>Outside the church, in three contiguous cells that form part of the
foundations, are:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; A dead Christ, the head of which is very impressive, while
the rest of the figure is poor.&nbsp; I examined the treatment of the
hair, which is terra-cotta, and compared it with all other like hair
in the chapels above described; I could find nothing like it, and think
it most likely that Giacomo Ferro did the figure, and got Tabachetti
to do the head, or that they brought the head from some unused figure
by Tabachetti at Varallo, for I know no other artist of the time and
neighbourhood who could have done it.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A Magdalene in the desert.&nbsp; The desert is a little
coal-cellar of an arch, containing a skull and a profusion of pink and
white paper bouquets, the two largest of which the Magdalene is hugging
while she is saying her prayers.&nbsp; She is a very self-sufficient
lady, who we may be sure will not stay in the desert a day longer than
she can help, and while there will flirt even with the skull if she
can find nothing better to flirt with.&nbsp; I cannot think that her
repentance is as yet genuine, and as for her praying there is no object
in her doing so, for she does not want anything.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In the next desert there is a very beautiful figure of St.
John the Baptist kneeling and looking upwards.&nbsp; This figure puzzles
me more than any other at Montrigone; it appears to be of the fifteenth
rather than the sixteenth century; it hardly reminds me of Gaudenzio,
and still less of any other Valsesian artist.&nbsp; It is a work of
unusual beauty, but I can form no idea as to its authorship.</p>
<p>I wrote the foregoing pages in the church at Montrigone itself, having
brought my camp-stool with me.&nbsp; It was Sunday; the church was open
all day, but there was no Mass said, and hardly anyone came.&nbsp; The
sacristan was a kind, gentle, little old man, who let me do whatever
I wanted.&nbsp; He sat on the doorstep of the main door, mending vestments,
and to this end was cutting up a fine piece of figured silk from one
to two hundred years old, which, if I could have got it, for half its
value, I should much like to have bought.&nbsp; I sat in the cool of
the church while he sat in the doorway, which was still in shadow, snipping
and snipping, and then sewing, I am sure with admirable neatness.&nbsp;
He made a charming picture, with the arched portico over his head, the
green grass and low church wall behind him, and then a lovely landscape
of wood and pasture and valleys and hillside.&nbsp; Every now and then
he would come and chirrup about Joachim, for he was pained and shocked
at my having said that his Joachim was someone else and not Joachim
at all.&nbsp; I said I was very sorry, but I was afraid the figure was
a woman.&nbsp; He asked me what he was to do.&nbsp; He had known it,
man and boy, this sixty years, and had always shown it as St. Joachim;
he had never heard anyone but myself question his ascription, and could
not suddenly change his mind about it at the bidding of a stranger.&nbsp;
At the same time he felt it was a very serious thing to continue showing
it as the Virgin&rsquo;s father if it was really her grandmother.&nbsp;
I told him I thought this was a case for his spiritual director, and
that if he felt uncomfortable about it he should consult his parish
priest and do as he was told.</p>
<p>On leaving Montrigone, with a pleasant sense of having made acquaintance
with a new and, in many respects, interesting work, I could not get
the sacristan and our difference of opinion out of my head.&nbsp; What,
I asked myself, are the differences that unhappily divide Christendom,
and what are those that divide Christendom from modern schools of thought,
but a seeing of Joachims as the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmothers on a larger
scale?&nbsp; True, we cannot call figures Joachim when we know perfectly
well that they are nothing of the kind; but I registered a vow that
henceforward when I called Joachims the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmothers
I would bear more in mind than I have perhaps always hitherto done,
how hard it is for those who have been taught to see them as Joachims
to think of them as something different.&nbsp; I trust that I have not
been unfaithful to this vow in the preceding article.&nbsp; If the reader
differs from me, let me ask him to remember how hard it is for one who
has got a figure well into his head as the Virgin&rsquo;s grandmother
to see it as Joachim.</p>
<h2>A Medieval Girl School <a name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166">{166}</a></h2>
<p>This last summer I revisited Oropa, near Biella, to see what connection
I could find between the Oropa chapels and those at Varallo.&nbsp; I
will take this opportunity of describing the chapels at Oropa, and more
especially the remarkable fossil, or petrified girl school, commonly
known as the <i>Dimora</i>, or Sojourn of the Virgin Mary in the Temple.</p>
<p>If I do not take these works so seriously as the reader may expect,
let me beg him, before he blames me, to go to Oropa and see the originals
for himself.&nbsp; Have the good people of Oropa themselves taken them
very seriously?&nbsp; Are we in an atmosphere where we need be at much
pains to speak with bated breath?&nbsp; We, as is well known, love to
take even our pleasures sadly; the Italians take even their sadness
<i>allegramente</i>, and combine devotion with amusement in a manner
that we shall do well to study if not imitate.&nbsp; For this best agrees
with what we gather to have been the custom of Christ himself, who,
indeed, never speaks of austerity but to condemn it.&nbsp; If Christianity
is to be a living faith, it must penetrate a man&rsquo;s whole life,
so that he can no more rid himself of it than he can of his flesh and
bones or of his breathing.&nbsp; The Christianity that can be taken
up and laid down as if it were a watch or a book is Christianity in
name only.&nbsp; The true Christian can no more part from Christ in
mirth than in sorrow.&nbsp; And, after all, what is the essence of Christianity?&nbsp;
What is the kernel of the nut?&nbsp; Surely common sense and cheerfulness,
with unflinching opposition to the charlatanisms and Pharisaisms of
a man&rsquo;s own times.&nbsp; The essence of Christianity lies neither
in dogma, nor yet in abnormally holy life, but in faith in an unseen
world, in doing one&rsquo;s duty, in speaking the truth, in finding
the true life rather in others than in oneself, and in the certain hope
that he who loses his life on these behalfs finds more than he has lost.&nbsp;
What can Agnosticism do against such Christianity as this?&nbsp; I should
be shocked if anything I had ever written or shall ever write should
seem to make light of these things.&nbsp; I should be shocked also if
<i>I</i> did not know how to be amused with things that amiable people
obviously intended to be amusing.</p>
<p>The reader may need to be reminded that Oropa is among the somewhat
infrequent sanctuaries at which the Madonna and infant Christ are not
white, but black.&nbsp; I shall return to this peculiarity of Oropa
later on, but will leave it for the present.&nbsp; For the general characteristics
of the place I must refer the reader to my book <i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i>.&nbsp;
I propose to confine myself here to the ten or a dozen chapels containing
life-sized terra-cotta figures, painted up to nature, that form one
of the main features of the place.&nbsp; At a first glance, perhaps,
all these chapels will seem uninteresting; I venture to think, however,
that some, if not most of them, though falling a good deal short of
the best work at Varallo and Crea, are still in their own way of considerable
importance.&nbsp; The first chapel with which we need concern ourselves
is numbered 4, and shows the Conception of the Virgin Mary.&nbsp; It
represents St. Anne as kneeling before a terrific dragon or, as the
Italians call it, &ldquo;insect,&rdquo; about the size of a Crystal
Palace pleiosaur.&nbsp; This &ldquo;insect&rdquo; is supposed to have
just had its head badly crushed by St. Anne, who seems to be begging
its pardon.&nbsp; The text &ldquo;Ipsa conteret caput tuum&rdquo; is
written outside the chapel.&nbsp; The figures have no artistic interest.&nbsp;
As regards dragons being called insects, the reader may perhaps remember
that the island of S. Giulio, in the Lago d&rsquo;Orta, was infested
with <i>insetti</i>, which S. Giulio destroyed, and which appear, in
a fresco underneath the church on the island, to have been monstrous
and ferocious dragons; but I cannot remember whether their bodies are
divided into three sections, and whether or no they have exactly six
legs&mdash;without which, I am told, they cannot be true insects.</p>
<p>The fifth chapel represents the Birth of the Virgin.&nbsp; Having
obtained permission to go inside it, I found the date 1715 cut large
and deep on the back of one figure before baking, and I imagine that
this date covers the whole.&nbsp; There is a Queen Anne feeling throughout
the composition, and if we were told that the sculptor and Francis Bird,
sculptor of the statue in front of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, had studied
under the same master, we could very well believe it.&nbsp; The apartment
in which the Virgin was born is spacious, and in striking contrast to
the one in which she herself gave birth to the Redeemer.&nbsp; St. Anne
occupies the centre of the composition, in an enormous bed; on her right
there is a lady of the George Cruikshank style of beauty, and on the
left an older person.&nbsp; Both are gesticulating and impressing upon
St. Anne the enormous obligation she has just conferred upon mankind;
they seem also to be imploring her not to overtax her strength, but,
strange to say, they are giving her neither flowers nor anything to
eat and drink.&nbsp; I know no other birth of the Virgin in which St.
Anne wants so little keeping up.</p>
<p>I have explained in my book <i>Ex Voto</i>, but should perhaps repeat
here, that the distinguishing characteristic of the Birth of the Virgin,
as rendered by Valsesian artists, is that St. Anne always has eggs immediately
after the infant is born, and usually a good deal more, whereas the
Madonna never has anything to eat or drink.&nbsp; The eggs are in accordance
with a custom that still prevails among the peasant classes in the Valsesia,
where women on giving birth to a child generally are given a <i>sabaglione</i>&mdash;an
egg beaten up with a little wine, or rum, and sugar.&nbsp; East of Milan
the Virgin&rsquo;s mother does not have eggs, and I suppose, from the
absence of the eggs at Oropa, that the custom above referred to does
not prevail in the Biellese district.&nbsp; The Virgin also is invariably
washed.&nbsp; St. John the Baptist, when he is born at all, which is
not very often, is also washed; but I have not observed that St. Elizabeth
has anything like the attention paid her that is given to St. Anne.&nbsp;
What, however, is wanting here at Oropa in meat and drink is made up
in Cupids; they swarm like flies on the walls, clouds, cornices, and
capitals of columns.</p>
<p>Against the right-hand wall are two lady-helps, each warming a towel
at a glowing fire, to be ready against the baby should come out of its
bath; while in the right-hand foreground we have the <i>levatrice</i>,
who having discharged her task, and being now so disposed, has removed
the bottle from the chimney-piece, and put it near some bread, fruit
and a chicken, over which she is about to discuss the confinement with
two other gossips.&nbsp; The <i>levatrice</i> is a very characteristic
figure, but the best in the chapel is the one of the head-nurse, near
the middle of the composition; she has now the infant in full charge,
and is showing it to St. Joachim, with an expression as though she were
telling him that her husband was a merry man.&nbsp; I am afraid Shakespeare
was dead before the sculptor was born, otherwise I should have felt
certain that he had drawn Juliet&rsquo;s nurse from this figure.&nbsp;
As for the little Virgin herself, I believe her to be a fine boy of
about ten months old.&nbsp; Viewing the work as a whole, if I only felt
more sure what artistic merit really is, I should say that, though the
chapel cannot be rated very highly from some standpoints, there are
others from which it may be praised warmly enough.&nbsp; It is innocent
of anatomy-worship, free from affectation or swagger, and not devoid
of a good deal of homely <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; It can no
more be compared with Tabachetti or Donatello than Hogarth can with
Rembrandt or Giovanni Bellini; but as it does not transcend the limitations
of its age, so neither is it wanting in whatever merits that age possessed;
and there is no age without merits of some kind.&nbsp; There is no inscription
saying who made the figures, but tradition gives them to Pietro Aureggio
Termine, of Biella, commonly called Aureggio.&nbsp; This is confirmed
by their strong resemblance to those in the <i>Dimora</i> Chapel, in
which there is an inscription that names Aureggio as the sculptor.</p>
<p>The sixth chapel deals with the Presentation of the Virgin in the
Temple.&nbsp; The Virgin is very small, but it must be remembered that
she is only seven years old and she is not nearly so small as she is
at Crea, where though a life-sized figure is intended, the head is hardly
bigger than an apple.&nbsp; She is rushing up the steps with open arms
towards the High Priest, who is standing at the top.&nbsp; For her it
is nothing alarming; it is the High Priest who appears frightened; but
it will all come right in time.&nbsp; The Virgin seems to be saying,
&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know me?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the Virgin Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But the High Priest does not feel so sure about that, and will make
further inquiries.&nbsp; The scene, which comprises some twenty figures,
is animated enough, and though it hardly kindles enthusiasm, still does
not fail to please.&nbsp; It looks as though of somewhat older date
than the Birth of the Virgin chapel, and I should say shows more signs
of direct Valsesian influence.&nbsp; In Marocco&rsquo;s book about Oropa
it is ascribed to Aureggio, but I find it difficult to accept this.</p>
<p>The seventh, and in many respects most interesting chapel at Oropa,
shows what is in reality a medieval Italian girl school, as nearly like
the thing itself as the artist could make it; we are expected, however,
to see in this the high-class kind of Girton College for young gentlewomen
that was attached to the Temple at Jerusalem, under the direction of
the Chief Priest&rsquo;s wife, or some one of his near female relatives.&nbsp;
Here all well-to-do Jewish young women completed their education, and
here accordingly we find the Virgin, whose parents desired she should
shine in every accomplishment, and enjoy all the advantages their ample
means commanded.</p>
<p>I have met with no traces of the Virgin during the years between
her Presentation in the Temple and her becoming head girl at Temple
College.&nbsp; These years, we may be assured, can hardly have been
other than eventful; but incidents, or bits of life, are like living
forms&mdash;it is only here and there, as by rare chance, that one of
them gets arrested and fossilized; the greater number disappear like
the greater number of antediluvian molluscs, and no one can say why
one of these flies, as it were, of life should get preserved in amber
more than another.&nbsp; Talk, indeed, about luck and cunning; what
a grain of sand as against a hundredweight is cunning&rsquo;s share
here as against luck&rsquo;s.&nbsp; What moment could be more humdrum
and unworthy of special record than the one chosen by the artist for
the chapel we are considering?&nbsp; Why should this one get arrested
in its flight and made immortal when so many worthier ones have perished?&nbsp;
Yet preserved it assuredly is; it is as though some fairy&rsquo;s wand
had struck the medieval Miss Pinkerton, Amelia Sedley, and others who
do duty instead of the Hebrew originals.&nbsp; It has locked them up
as sleeping beauties, whose charms all may look upon.&nbsp; Surely the
hours are like the women grinding at the mill&mdash;the one is taken
and the other left, and none can give the reason more than he can say
why Gallio should have won immortality by caring for none of &ldquo;these
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems to me, moreover, that fairies have changed their practice
now in the matter of sleeping beauties, much as shopkeepers have done
in Regent Street.&nbsp; Formerly the shopkeeper used to shut up his
goods behind strong shutters, so that no one might see them after closing
hours.&nbsp; Now he leaves everything open to the eye and turns the
gas on.&nbsp; So the fairies, who used to lock up their sleeping beauties
in impenetrable thickets, now leave them in the most public places they
can find, as knowing that they will there most certainly escape notice.&nbsp;
Look at De Hooghe; look at <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, or even
Shakespeare himself&mdash;how long they slept unawakened, though they
were in broad daylight and on the public thoroughfares all the time.&nbsp;
Look at Tabachetti, and the masterpieces he left at Varallo.&nbsp; His
figures there are exposed to the gaze of every passer-by; yet who heeds
them?&nbsp; Who, save a very few, even know of their existence?&nbsp;
Look again at Gaudenzio Ferrari, or the &ldquo;Danse des Paysans,&rdquo;
by Holbein, to which I ventured to call attention in the <i>Universal
Review</i>.&nbsp; No, no; if a thing be in Central Africa, it is the
glory of this age to find it out; so the fairies think it safer to conceal
their <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> under a show of openness; for the
schoolmaster is much abroad, and there is no hedge so thick or so thorny
as the dulness of culture.</p>
<p>It may be, again, that ever so many years hence, when Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
earth-worms shall have buried Oropa hundreds of feet deep, someone sinking
a well or making a railway-cutting will unearth these chapels, and will
believe them to have been houses, and to contain the <i>exuvi&aelig;</i>
of the living forms that tenanted them.&nbsp; In the meantime, however,
let us return to a consideration of the chapel as it may now be seen
by anyone who cares to pass that way.</p>
<p>The work consists of about forty figures in all, not counting Cupids,
and is divided into four main divisions.&nbsp; First, there is the large
public sitting-room or drawing-room of the College, where the elder
young ladies are engaged in various elegant employments.&nbsp; Three,
at a table to the left, are making a mitre for the Bishop, as may be
seen from the model on the table.&nbsp; Some are merely spinning or
about to spin.&nbsp; One young lady, sitting rather apart from the others,
is doing an elaborate piece of needlework at a tambour-frame near the
window; others are making lace or slippers, probably for the new curate;
another is struggling with a letter, or perhaps a theme, which seems
to be giving her a good deal of trouble, but which, when done, will,
I am sure, be beautiful.&nbsp; One dear little girl is simply reading
<i>Paul and Virginia</i> underneath the window, and is so concealed
that I hardly think she can be seen from the outside at all, though
from inside she is delightful; it was with great regret that I could
not get her into any photograph.&nbsp; One most amiable young woman
has got a child&rsquo;s head on her lap, the child having played itself
to sleep.&nbsp; All are industriously and agreeably employed in some
way or other; all are plump; all are nice-looking; there is not one
Becky Sharp in the whole school; on the contrary, as in &ldquo;Pious
Orgies,&rdquo; all is pious&mdash;or sub-pious&mdash;and all, if not
great, is at least eminently respectable.&nbsp; One feels that St. Joachim
and St. Anne could not have chosen a school more judiciously, and that
if one had a daughter oneself this is exactly where one would wish to
place her.&nbsp; If there is a fault of any kind in the arrangements,
it is that they do not keep cats enough.&nbsp; The place is overrun
with mice, though what these can find to eat I know not.&nbsp; It occurs
to me also that the young ladies might be kept a little more free of
spiders&rsquo; webs; but in all these chapels, bats, mice, and spiders
are troublesome.</p>
<p>Off the main drawing-room on the side facing the window there is
a da&iuml;s, which is approached by a large raised semicircular step,
higher than the rest of the floor, but lower than the da&iuml;s itself.&nbsp;
The da&iuml;s is, of course, reserved for the venerable Lady Principal
and the under-mistresses, one of whom, by the way, is a little more
<i>mondaine</i> than might have been expected, and is admiring herself
in a looking-glass&mdash;unless, indeed, she is only looking to see
if there is a spot of ink on her face.&nbsp; The Lady Principal is seated
near a table, on which lie some books in expensive bindings, which I
imagine to have been presented to her by the parents of pupils who were
leaving school.&nbsp; One has given her a photographic album; another
a large scrapbook, for illustrations of all kinds; a third volume has
red edges, and is presumably of a devotional character.&nbsp; If I dared
venture another criticism, I should say it would be better not to keep
the ink-pot on the top of these books.&nbsp; The Lady Principal is being
read to by the monitress for the week, whose duty it was to recite selected
passages from the most approved Hebrew writers; she appears to be a
good deal outraged, possibly at the faulty intonation of the reader,
which she has long tried vainly to correct; or perhaps she has been
hearing of the atrocious way in which her forefathers had treated the
prophets, and is explaining to the young ladies how impossible it would
be, in their own more enlightened age, for a prophet to fail of recognition.</p>
<p>On the half-da&iuml;s, as I suppose the large semicircular step between
the main room and the da&iuml;s should be called, we find, first, the
monitress for the week, who stands up while she recites; and secondly,
the Virgin herself, who is the only pupil allowed a seat so near to
the august presence of the Lady Principal.&nbsp; She is ostensibly doing
a piece of embroidery which is stretched on a cushion on her lap, but
I should say that she was chiefly interested in the nearest of four
pretty little Cupids, who are all trying to attract her attention, though
they pay no court to any other young lady.&nbsp; I have sometimes wondered
whether the obviously scandalized gesture of the Lady Principal might
not be directed at these Cupids, rather than at anything the monitress
may have been reading, for she would surely find them disquieting.&nbsp;
Or she may be saying, &ldquo;Why, bless me!&nbsp; I do declare the Virgin
has got another hamper, and St. Anne&rsquo;s cakes are always so terribly
rich!&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly the hamper is there, close to the Virgin,
and the Lady Principal&rsquo;s action may be well directed at it, but
it may have been sent to some other young lady, and be put on the sub-da&iuml;s
for public exhibition.&nbsp; It looks as if it might have come from
Fortnum and Mason&rsquo;s, and I half expected to find a label, addressing
it to &ldquo;The Virgin Mary, Temple College, Jerusalem,&rdquo; but
if ever there was one the mice have long since eaten it.&nbsp; The Virgin
herself does not seem to care much about it, but if she has a fault
it is that she is generally a little apathetic.</p>
<p>Whose the hamper was, however, is a point we shall never now certainly
determine, for the best fossil is worse than the worst living form.&nbsp;
Why, alas! was not Mr. Edison alive when this chapel was made?&nbsp;
We might then have had a daily phonographic recital of the conversation,
and an announcement might be put outside the chapels, telling us at
what hours the figures would speak.</p>
<p>On either side of the main room there are two annexes opening out
from it; these are reserved chiefly for the younger children, some of
whom, I think, are little boys.&nbsp; In the left annex, behind the
ladies who are making a mitre, there is a child who has got a cake,
and another has some fruit&mdash;possibly given them by the Virgin&mdash;and
a third child is begging for some of it.&nbsp; The light failed so completely
here that I was not able to photograph any of these figures.&nbsp; It
was a dull September afternoon, and the clouds had settled thick round
the chapel, which is never very light, and is nearly 4000 feet above
the sea.&nbsp; I waited till such twilight as made it hopeless that
more detail could be got&mdash;and a queer ghostly place enough it was
to wait in&mdash;but after giving the plate an exposure of fifty minutes,
I saw I could get no more, and desisted.</p>
<p>These long photographic exposures have the advantage that one is
compelled to study a work in detail through mere lack of other employment,
and that one can take one&rsquo;s notes in peace without being tempted
to hurry over them; but even so I continually find I have omitted to
note, and have clean forgotten, much that I want later on.</p>
<p>In the other annex there are also one or two younger children, but
it seems to have been set apart for conversation and relaxation more
than any other part of the establishment.</p>
<p>I have already said that the work is signed by an inscription inside
the chapel, to the effect that the sculptures are by Pietro Aureggio
Termine di Biella.&nbsp; It will be seen that the young ladies are exceedingly
like one another, and that the artist aimed at nothing more than a faithful
rendering of the life of his own times.&nbsp; Let us be thankful that
he aimed at nothing less.&nbsp; Perhaps his wife kept a girls&rsquo;
school; or he may have had a large family of fat, good-natured daughters,
whose little ways he had studied attentively; at all events the work
is full of spontaneous incident, and cannot fail to become more and
more interesting as the age it renders falls farther back into the past.&nbsp;
It is to be regretted that many artists, better-known men, have not
been satisfied with the humbler ambitions of this most amiable and interesting
sculptor.&nbsp; If he has left us no laboured life-studies, he has at
least done something for us which we can find nowhere else, which we
should be very sorry not to have, and the fidelity of which to Italian
life at the beginning of the eighteenth century will not be disputed.</p>
<p>The eighth chapel is that of the <i>Sposalizio</i>, is certainly
not by Aureggio, and I should say was mainly by the same sculptor who
did the Presentation in the Temple.&nbsp; On going inside I found the
figures had come from more than one source; some of them are constructed
so absolutely on Valsesian principles, as regards technique, that it
may be assumed they came from Varallo.&nbsp; Each of these last figures
is in three pieces, that are baked separately and cemented together
afterwards, hence they are more easily transported; no more clay is
used than is absolutely necessary; and the off-side of the figure is
neglected; they will be found chiefly, if not entirely, at the top of
the steps.&nbsp; The other figures are more solidly built, and do not
remind me in their business features of anything in the Valsesia.&nbsp;
There was a sculptor, Francesco Sala, of Locarno (doubtless the village
a short distance below Varallo, and not the Locarno on the Lago Maggiore),
who made designs for some of the Oropa chapels, and some of whose letters
are still preserved, but whether the Valsesian figures in this present
work are by him or not I cannot say.</p>
<p>The statues are twenty-five in number; I could find no date or signature;
the work reminds me of Montrigone; several of the figures are not at
all bad, and several have horsehair for hair, as at Varallo.&nbsp; The
effect of the whole composition is better than we have a right to expect
from any sculpture dating from the beginning of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The ninth chapel, the Annunciation, presents no feature of interest;
nor yet does the tenth, the Visit of Mary to Elizabeth.&nbsp; The eleventh,
the Nativity, though rather better, is still not remarkable.</p>
<p>The twelfth, the Purification, is absurdly bad, but I do not know
whether the expression of strong personal dislike to the Virgin which
the High Priest wears is intended as prophetic, or whether it is the
result of incompetence, or whether it is merely a smile gone wrong in
the baking.&nbsp; It is amusing to find Marocco, who has not been strict
about arch&aelig;ological accuracy hitherto, complain here that there
is an anachronism, inasmuch as some young ecclesiastics are dressed
as they would be at present, and one of them actually carries a wax
candle.&nbsp; This is not as it should be; in works like those at Oropa,
where implicit reliance is justly placed on the earnest endeavours that
have been so successfully made to thoroughly and carefully and patiently
ensure the accuracy of the minutest details, it is a pity that even
a single error should have escaped detection; this, however, has most
unfortunately happened here, and Marocco feels it his duty to put us
on our guard.&nbsp; He explains that the mistake arose from the sculptor&rsquo;s
having taken both his general arrangement and his details from some
picture of the fourteenth or fifteenth century, when the value of the
strictest historical accuracy was not yet so fully understood.</p>
<p>It seems to me that in the matter of accuracy, priests and men of
science whether lay or regular on the one hand, and plain people whether
lay or regular on the other, are trying to play a different game, and
fail to understand one another because they do not see that their objects
are not the same.&nbsp; The cleric and the man of science (who is only
the cleric in his latest development) are trying to develop a throat
with two distinct passages&mdash;one that shall refuse to pass even
the smallest gnat, and another that shall gracefully gulp even the largest
camel; whereas we men of the street desire but one throat, and are content
that this shall swallow nothing bigger than a pony.&nbsp; Everyone knows
that there is no such effectual means of developing the power to swallow
camels as incessant watchfulness for opportunities of straining at gnats,
and this should explain many passages that puzzle us in the work both
of our clerics and our scientists.&nbsp; I, not being a man of science,
still continue to do what I said I did in <i>Alps and Sanctuaries</i>,
and make it a rule to earnestly and patiently and carefully swallow
a few of the smallest gnats I can find several times a day, as the best
astringent for the throat I know of.</p>
<p>The thirteenth chapel is the Marriage Feast at Cana of Galilee.&nbsp;
This is the best chapel as a work of art; indeed, it is the only one
which can claim to be taken quite seriously.&nbsp; Not that all the
figures are very good; those to the left of the composition are commonplace
enough; nor are the Christ and the giver of the feast at all remarkable;
but the ten or dozen figures of guests and attendants at the right-hand
end of the work are as good as anything of their kind can be, and remind
me so strongly of Tabachetti that I cannot doubt they were done by someone
who was indirectly influenced by that great sculptor&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;
It is not likely that Tabachetti was alive long after 1640, by which
time he would have been about eighty years old; and the foundations
of this chapel were not laid till about 1690; the statues are probably
a few years later; they can hardly, therefore, be by one who had even
studied under Tabachetti; but until I found out the dates, and went
inside the chapel to see the way in which the figures had been constructed,
I was inclined to think they might be by Tabachetti himself, of whom,
indeed, they are not unworthy.&nbsp; On examining the figures I found
them more heavily constructed than Tabachetti&rsquo;s are, with smaller
holes for taking out superfluous clay, and more finished on the off-sides.&nbsp;
Marocco says the sculptor is not known.&nbsp; I looked in vain for any
date or signature.&nbsp; Possibly the right-hand figures (for the left-hand
ones can hardly be by the same hand) may be by some sculptor from Crea,
which is at no very great distance from Oropa, who was penetrated by
Tabachetti&rsquo;s influence; but whether as regards action and concert
with one another, or as regards excellence in detail, I do not see how
anything can be more realistic, and yet more harmoniously composed.&nbsp;
The placing of the musicians in a minstrels&rsquo; gallery helps the
effect; these musicians are six in number, and the other figures are
twenty-three.&nbsp; Under the table, between Christ and the giver of
the feast, there is a cat.</p>
<p>The fourteenth chapel, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, is without
interest.</p>
<p>The fifteenth, the Coronation of the Virgin, contains forty-six angels,
twenty-six cherubs, fifty-six saints, the Holy Trinity, the Madonna
herself, and twenty-four innocents, making 156 statues in all.&nbsp;
Of these I am afraid there is not one of more than ordinary merit; the
most interesting is a half-length nude life-study of Disma&mdash;the
good thief.&nbsp; After what had been promised him it was impossible
to exclude him, but it was felt that a half-length nude figure would
be as much as he could reasonably expect.</p>
<p>Behind the sanctuary there is a semi-ruinous and wholly valueless
work, which shows the finding of the black image, which is now in the
church, but is only shown on great festivals.</p>
<p>This leads us to a consideration that I have delayed till now.&nbsp;
The black image is the central feature of Oropa; it is the <i>raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the whole place, and all else is a mere incrustation,
so to speak, around it.&nbsp; According to this image, then, which was
carved by St. Luke himself, and than which nothing can be better authenticated,
both the Madonna and the infant Christ were as black as anything can
be conceived.&nbsp; It is not likely that they were as black as they
have been painted; no one yet ever was so black as that; yet, even allowing
for some exaggeration on St. Luke&rsquo;s part, they must have been
exceedingly black if the portrait is to be accepted; and uncompromisingly
black they accordingly are on most of the wayside chapels for many a
mile around Oropa.&nbsp; Yet in the chapels we have been hitherto considering&mdash;works
in which, as we know, the most punctilious regard has been shown to
accuracy&mdash;both the Virgin and Christ are uncompromisingly white.&nbsp;
As in the shops under the Colonnade where devotional knick-knacks are
sold, you can buy a black china image or a white one, whichever you
like; so with the pictures&mdash;the black and white are placed side
by side&mdash;<i>pagando il danaro si pu&ograve; scegliere</i>.&nbsp;
It rests not with history or with the Church to say whether the Madonna
and Child were black or white, but you may settle it for yourself, whichever
way you please, or rather you are required, with the acquiescence of
the Church, to hold that they were both black and white at one and the
same time.</p>
<p>It cannot be maintained that the Church leaves the matter undecided,
and by tolerating both types proclaims the question an open one, for
she acquiesces in the portrait by St. Luke as genuine.&nbsp; How, then,
justify the whiteness of the Holy Family in the chapels?&nbsp; If the
portrait is not known as genuine, why set such a stumbling-block in
our paths as to show us a black Madonna and a white one, both as historically
accurate, within a few yards of one another?</p>
<p>I ask this not in mockery, but as knowing that the Church must have
an explanation to give, if she would only give it, and as myself unable
to find any, even the most far-fetched, that can bring what we see at
Oropa, Loreto and elsewhere into harmony with modern conscience, either
intellectual or ethical.</p>
<p>I see, indeed, from an interesting article in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>
for September, 1889, entitled &ldquo;The Black Madonna of Loreto,&rdquo;
that black Madonnas were so frequent in ancient Christian art that &ldquo;some
of the early writers of the Church felt obliged to account for it by
explaining that the Virgin was of a very dark complexion, as might be
proved by the verse of Canticles which says, &lsquo;I am black, but
comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem.&rsquo;&nbsp; Others maintained
that she became black during her sojourn in Egypt. . . .&nbsp; Priests,
of to-day, say that extreme age and exposure to the smoke of countless
altar-candles have caused that change in complexion which the more na&iuml;ve
fathers of the Church attributed to the power of an Egyptian sun&rdquo;;
but the writer ruthlessly disposes of this supposition by pointing out
that in nearly all the instances of black Madonnas it is the flesh alone
that is entirely black, the crimson of the lips, the white of the eyes,
and the draperies having preserved their original colour.&nbsp; The
authoress of the article (Mrs. Hilliard) goes on to tell us that Pausanias
mentions two statues of the black Venus, and says that the oldest statue
of Ceres among the Phigalenses was black.&nbsp; She adds that Minerva
Aglaurus, the daughter of Cecrops, at Athens, was black; that Corinth
had a black Venus, as also the Thespians; that the oracles of Dodona
and Delphi were founded by black doves, the emissaries of Venus, and
that the Isis Multimammia in the Capitol at Rome is black.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have asked myself whether the Church does not intend
to suggest that the whole story falls outside the domain of history,
and is to be held as the one great epos, or myth, common to all mankind;
adaptable by each nation according to its own several needs; translatable,
so to speak, into the facts of each individual nation, as the written
word is translatable into its language, but appertaining to the realm
of the imagination rather than to that of the understanding, and precious
for spiritual rather than literal truths.&nbsp; More briefly, I have
wondered whether she may not intend that such details as whether the
Virgin was white or black are of very little importance in comparison
with the basing of ethics on a story that shall appeal to black races
as well as to white ones.</p>
<p>If so, it is time we were made to understand this more clearly.&nbsp;
If the Church, whether of Rome or England, would lean to some such view
as this&mdash;tainted though it be with mysticism&mdash;if we could
see either great branch of the Church make a frank, authoritative attempt
to bring its teaching into greater harmony with the educated understanding
and conscience of the time, instead of trying to fetter that understanding
with bonds that gall it daily more and more profoundly; then I, for
one, in view of the difficulty and graciousness of the task, and in
view of the great importance of historical continuity, would gladly
sink much of my own private opinion as to the value of the Christian
ideal, and would gratefully help either Church or both, according to
the best of my very feeble ability.&nbsp; On these terms, indeed, I
could swallow not a few camels myself cheerfully enough.</p>
<p>Can we, however, see any signs as though either Rome or England will
stir hand or foot to meet us?&nbsp; Can any step be pointed to as though
either Church wished to make things easier for men holding the opinions
held by the late Mr. Darwin, or by Mr. Herbert Spencer and Professor
Huxley?&nbsp; How can those who accept evolution with any thoroughness
accept such doctrines as the Incarnation or the Redemption with any
but a quasi-allegorical and poetical interpretation?&nbsp; Can we conceivably
accept these doctrines in the literal sense in which the Church advances
them?&nbsp; And can the leaders of the Church be blind to the resistlessness
of the current that has set against those literal interpretations which
she seems to hug more and more closely the more religious life is awakened
at all?&nbsp; The clergyman is wanted as supplementing the doctor and
the lawyer in all civilized communities; these three keep watch on one
another, and prevent one another from becoming too powerful.&nbsp; I,
who distrust the <i>doctrinaire</i> in science even more than the <i>doctrinaire</i>
in religion, should view with dismay the abolition of the Church of
England, as knowing that a blatant bastard science would instantly step
into her shoes; but if some such deplorable consummation is to be avoided
in England, it can only be through more evident leaning on the part
of our clergy to such an interpretation of the Sacred History as the
presence of a black and white Madonna almost side by side at Oropa appears
to suggest.</p>
<p>I fear that in these last paragraphs I may have trenched on dangerous
ground, but it is not possible to go to such places as Oropa without
asking oneself what they mean and involve.&nbsp; As for the average
Italian pilgrims, they do not appear to give the matter so much as a
thought.&nbsp; They love Oropa, and flock to it in thousands during
the summer; the President of the Administration assured me that they
lodged, after a fashion, as many as ten thousand pilgrims on the 15th
of last August.&nbsp; It is astonishing how living the statues are to
these people, and how the wicked are upbraided and the good applauded.&nbsp;
At Varallo, since I took the photographs I published in my book <i>Ex
Voto</i>, an angry pilgrim has smashed the nose of the dwarf in Tabachetti&rsquo;s
Journey to Calvary, for no other reason than inability to restrain his
indignation against one who was helping to inflict pain on Christ.&nbsp;
It is the real hair and the painting up to nature that does this.&nbsp;
Here at Oropa I found a paper on the floor of the <i>Sposalizio</i>
Chapel, which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the grace of God and the will of the administrative chapter
of this sanctuary, there have come here to work --- ---, mason, ---
---, carpenter, and --- ---, plumber, all of Chiavazza, on the twenty-first
day of January, 1886, full of cold (<i>pieni di freddo</i>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;They write these two lines to record their visit.&nbsp; They
pray the Blessed Virgin that she will maintain them safe and sound from
everything equivocal that may befall them (<i>sempre sani e salvi da
ogni equivoco li possa accadere</i>).&nbsp; Oh, farewell!&nbsp; We reverently
salute all the present statues, and especially the Blessed Virgin, and
the reader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the <i>Universal Review</i>, I suppose, all its readers are
to consider themselves saluted; at any rate, these good fellows, in
the effusiveness of their hearts, actually wrote the above in pencil.&nbsp;
I was sorely tempted to steal it, but, after copying it, left it in
the Chief Priest&rsquo;s hands instead.</p>
<h2>Art in the Valley of Saas <a name="citation188"></a><a href="#footnote188">{188}</a></h2>
<p>Having been told by Mr. Fortescue, of the British Museum, that there
were some chapels at Saas-F&eacute;e which bore analogy to those at
Varallo, described in my book <i>Ex Voto</i>, I went to Saas during
this last summer, and venture now to lay my conclusions before the reader.</p>
<p>The chapels are fifteen in number, and lead up to a larger and singularly
graceful one, rather more than half-way between Saas and Saas-F&eacute;e.&nbsp;
This is commonly but wrongly called the chapel of St. Joseph, for it
is dedicated to the Virgin, and its situation is of such extreme beauty&mdash;the
great F&eacute;e glaciers showing through the open portico&mdash;that
it is in itself worth a pilgrimage.&nbsp; It is surrounded by noble
larches and overhung by rock; in front of the portico there is a small
open space covered with grass, and a huge larch, the stem of which is
girt by a rude stone seat.&nbsp; The portico itself contains seats for
worshippers, and a pulpit from which the preacher&rsquo;s voice can
reach the many who must stand outside.&nbsp; The walls of the inner
chapel are hung with votive pictures, some of them very quaint and pleasing,
and not overweighted by those qualities that are usually dubbed by the
name of artistic merit.&nbsp; Innumerable wooden and waxen representations
of arms, legs, eyes, ears and babies tell of the cures that have been
effected during two centuries of devotion, and can hardly fail to awaken
a kindly sympathy with the long dead and forgotten folks who placed
them where they are.</p>
<p>The main interest, however, despite the extreme loveliness of the
St. Mary&rsquo;s Chapel, centres rather in the small and outwardly unimportant
oratories (if they should be so called) that lead up to it.&nbsp; These
begin immediately with the ascent from the level ground on which the
village of Saas-im-Grund is placed, and contain scenes in the history
of the Redemption, represented by rude but spirited wooden figures,
each about two feet high, painted, gilt, and rendered as life-like in
all respects as circumstances would permit.&nbsp; The figures have suffered
a good deal from neglect, and are still not a little misplaced.&nbsp;
With the assistance, however, of the Rev. E. J. Selwyn, English Chaplain
at Saas-im-Grund, I have been able to replace many of them in their
original positions, as indicated by the parts of the figures that are
left rough-hewn and unpainted.&nbsp; They vary a good deal in interest,
and can be easily sneered at by those who make a trade of sneering.&nbsp;
Those, on the other hand, who remain unsophisticated by overmuch art-culture
will find them full of character in spite of not a little rudeness of
execution, and will be surprised at coming across such works in a place
so remote from any art-centre as Saas must have been at the time these
chapels were made.&nbsp; It will be my business therefore to throw what
light I can upon the questions how they came to be made at all, and
who was the artist who designed them.</p>
<p>The only documentary evidence consists in a chronicle of the valley
of Saas written in the early years of this century by the Rev. Peter
Jos. Ruppen, and published at Sion in 1851.&nbsp; This work makes frequent
reference to a manuscript by the Rev. Peter Joseph Clemens Lommatter,
<i>cur&eacute;</i> of Saas-F&eacute;e from 1738 to 1751, which has unfortunately
been lost, so that we have no means of knowing how closely it was adhered
to.&nbsp; The Rev. Jos.&nbsp; Ant.&nbsp; Ruppen, the present excellent
<i>cur&eacute;</i> of Saas-im-Grund, assures me that there is no reference
to the Saas-F&eacute;e oratories in the &ldquo;Actes de l&rsquo;Eglise&rdquo;
at Saas, which I understand go a long way back; but I have not seen
these myself.&nbsp; Practically, then, we have no more documentary evidence
than is to be found in the published chronicle above referred to.</p>
<p>We there find it stated that the large chapel, commonly, but as above
explained, wrongly called St. Joseph&rsquo;s, was built in 1687, and
enlarged by subscription in 1747.&nbsp; These dates appear on the building
itself, and are no doubt accurate.&nbsp; The writer adds that there
was no actual edifice on this site before the one now existing was built,
but there was a miraculous picture of the Virgin placed in a mural niche,
before which the pious herdsmen and devout inhabitants of the valley
worshipped under the vault of heaven. <a name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190">{190}</a>&nbsp;
A miraculous (or miracle-working) picture was always more or less rare
and important; the present site, therefore, seems to have been long
one of peculiar sanctity.&nbsp; Possibly the name F&eacute;e may point
to still earlier pagan mysteries on the same site.</p>
<p>As regards the fifteen small chapels, the writer says they illustrate
the fifteen mysteries of the Psalter, and were built in 1709, each householder
of the Saas-F&eacute;e contributing one chapel.&nbsp; He adds that Heinrich
Andenmatten, afterwards a brother of the Society of Jesus, was an especial
benefactor or promoter of the undertaking.&nbsp; One of the chapels,
the Ascension (No. 12 of the series), has the date 1709 painted on it;
but there is no date on any other chapel, and there seems no reason
why this should be taken as governing the whole series.</p>
<p>Over and above this, there exists in Saas a tradition, as I was told
immediately on my arrival, by an English visitor, that the chapels were
built in consequence of a flood, but I have vainly endeavoured to trace
this story to an indigenous source.</p>
<p>The internal evidence of the wooden figures themselves&mdash;nothing
analogous to which, it should be remembered, can be found in the chapel
of 1687&mdash;points to a much earlier date.&nbsp; I have met with no
school of sculpture belonging to the early part of the eighteenth century
to which they can be plausibly assigned; and the supposition that they
are the work of some unknown local genius who was not led up to and
left no successors may be dismissed, for the work is too scholarly to
have come from anyone but a trained sculptor.&nbsp; I refer of course
to those figures which the artist must be supposed to have executed
with his own hand, as, for example, the central figure of the Crucifixion
group and those of the Magdalene and St. John.&nbsp; The greater number
of the figures were probably, as was suggested to me by Mr. Ranshaw,
of Lowth, executed by a local wood-carver from models in clay and wax
furnished by the artist himself.&nbsp; Those who examine the play of
line in the hair, mantle, and sleeve of the Magdalene in the Crucifixion
group, and contrast it with the greater part of the remaining draperies,
will find little hesitation in concluding that this was the case, and
will ere long readily distinguish the two hands from which the figures
have mainly come.&nbsp; I say &ldquo;mainly,&rdquo; because there is
at least one other sculptor who may well have belonged to the year 1709,
but who fortunately has left us little.&nbsp; Examples of his work may
perhaps be seen in the nearest villain with a big hat in the Flagellation
chapel, and in two cherubs in the Assumption of the Virgin.</p>
<p>We may say, then, with some certainty, that the designer was a cultivated
and practised artist.&nbsp; We may also not less certainly conclude
that he was of Flemish origin, for the horses in the Journey to Calvary
and Crucifixion chapels, where alone there are any horses at all, are
of Flemish breed, with no trace of the Arab blood adopted by Gaudenzio
at Varallo.&nbsp; The character, moreover, of the villains is Northern&mdash;of
the Quentin Matsys, Martin Schongauer type, rather than Italian; the
same sub-Rubensesque feeling which is apparent in more than one chapel
at Varallo is not less evident here&mdash;especially in the Journey
to Calvary and Crucifixion chapels.&nbsp; There can hardly, therefore,
be a doubt that the artist was a Fleming who had worked for several
years in Italy.</p>
<p>It is also evident that he had Tabachetti&rsquo;s work at Varallo
well in his mind.&nbsp; For not only does he adopt certain details of
costume (I refer particularly to the treatment of soldiers&rsquo; tunics)
which are peculiar to Tabachetti at Varallo, but whenever he treats
a subject which Tabachetti had treated at Varallo, as in the Flagellation,
Crowning with Thorns, and Journey to Calvary chapels, the work at Saas
is evidently nothing but a somewhat modified abridgment of that at Varallo.&nbsp;
When, however, as in the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Crucifixion,
and other chapels, the work at Varallo is by another than Tabachetti,
no allusion is made to it.&nbsp; The Saas artist has Tabachetti&rsquo;s
Varallo work at his finger-ends, but betrays no acquaintance whatever
with Gaudenzio Ferrari, Gio. Ant.&nbsp; Paracca, or Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico.</p>
<p>Even, moreover, when Tabachetti&rsquo;s work at Varallo is being
most obviously drawn from, as in the Journey to Calvary chapel, the
Saas version differs materially from that at Varallo, and is in some
respects an improvement on it.&nbsp; The idea of showing other horsemen
and followers coming up from behind, whose heads can be seen over the
crown of the interposing hill, is singularly effective as suggesting
a number of others that are unseen, nor can I conceive that anyone but
the original designer would follow Tabachetti&rsquo;s Varallo design
with as much closeness as it has been followed here, and yet make such
a brilliantly successful modification.&nbsp; The stumbling, again, of
one horse (a detail almost hidden, according to Tabachetti&rsquo;s wont)
is a touch which Tabachetti himself might add, but which no Saas wood-carver
who was merely adapting from a reminiscence of Tabachetti&rsquo;s Varallo
chapel would be likely to introduce.&nbsp; These considerations have
convinced me that the designer of the chapels at Saas is none other
than Tabachetti himself, who, as has been now conclusively shown, was
a native of Dinant, in Belgium.</p>
<p>The Saas chronicler, indeed, avers that the chapels were not built
till 1709&mdash;a statement apparently corroborated by a date now visible
on one chapel; but we must remember that the chronicler did not write
until a century or so later than 1709, and though indeed, his statement
may have been taken from the lost earlier manuscript of 1738, we know
nothing about this either one way or the other.&nbsp; The writer may
have gone by the still existing 1709 on the Ascension chapel, whereas
this date may in fact have referred to a restoration, and not to an
original construction.&nbsp; There is nothing, as I have said, in the
choice of the chapel on which the date appears, to suggest that it was
intended to govern the others.&nbsp; I have explained that the work
is isolated and exotic.&nbsp; It is by one in whom Flemish and Italian
influences are alike equally predominant; by one who was saturated with
Tabachetti&rsquo;s Varallo work, and who can improve upon it, but over
whom the other Varallo sculptors have no power.&nbsp; The style of the
work is of the sixteenth and not of the eighteenth century&mdash;with
a few obvious exceptions that suit the year 1709 exceedingly well.&nbsp;
Against such considerations as these, a statement made at the beginning
of this century referring to a century earlier and a promiscuous date
upon one chapel, can carry but little weight.&nbsp; I shall assume,
therefore, henceforward, that we have here groups designed in a plastic
material by Tabachetti, and reproduced in wood by the best local wood-sculptor
available, with the exception of a few figures cut by the artist himself.</p>
<p>We ask, then, at what period in his life did Tabachetti design these
chapels, and what led to his coming to such an out-of-the-way place
as Saas at all?&nbsp; We should remember that, according both to Fassola
and Torrotti (writing in 1671 and 1686 respectively), Tabachetti <a name="citation195"></a><a href="#footnote195">{195}</a>
became insane about the year 1586 or early in 1587, after having just
begun the Salutation chapel.&nbsp; I have explained in <i>Ex Voto</i>
that I do not believe this story.&nbsp; I have no doubt that Tabachetti
was declared to be mad, but I believe this to have been due to an intrigue,
set on foot in order to get a foreign artist out of the way, and to
secure the Massacre of the Innocents chapel, at that precise time undertaken,
for Gio. Ant.&nbsp; Paracca, who was an Italian.</p>
<p>Or he may have been sacrificed in order to facilitate the return
of the workers in stucco whom he had superseded on the Sacro Monte.&nbsp;
He may have been goaded into some imprudence which was seized upon as
a pretext for shutting him up; at any rate, the fact that when in 1587
he inherited his father&rsquo;s property at Dinant, his trustee (he
being expressly stated to be &ldquo;<i>expatri&eacute;</i>&rdquo;) was
&ldquo;<i>datif</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>dativus</i>,&rdquo; appointed
not by himself but by the court, lends colour to the statement that
he was not his own master at the time; for in later kindred deeds, now
at Namur, he appoints his own trustee.&nbsp; I suppose, then, that Tabachetti
was shut up in a madhouse at Varallo for a considerable time, during
which I can find no trace of him, but that eventually he escaped or
was released.</p>
<p>Whether he was a fugitive, or whether he was let out from prison,
he would in either case, in all reasonable probability, turn his face
homeward.&nbsp; If he was escaping, he would make immediately for the
Savoy frontier, within which Saas then lay.&nbsp; He would cross the
Baranca above Fobello, coming down on to Ponte Grande in the Val Anzasca.&nbsp;
He would go up the Val Anzasca to Macugnaga, and over the Monte Moro,
which would bring him immediately to Saas.&nbsp; Saas, therefore, is
the nearest and most natural place for him to make for, if he were flying
from Varallo, and here I suppose him to have halted.</p>
<p>It so happened that on the 9th of September, 1589, there was one
of the three great outbreaks of the Mattmark See that have from time
to time devastated the valley of Saas. <a name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196">{196}</a>&nbsp;
It is probable that the chapels were decided upon in consequence of
some grace shown by the miraculous picture of the Virgin, which had
mitigated a disaster occurring so soon after the anniversary of her
own Nativity.&nbsp; Tabachetti, arriving at this juncture, may have
offered to undertake them if the Saas people would give him an asylum.&nbsp;
Here, at any rate, I suppose him to have stayed till some time in 1590,
probably the second half of it; his design of eventually returning home,
if he ever entertained it, being then interrupted by a summons to Crea
near Casale, where I believe him to have worked with a few brief interruptions
thenceforward for little if at all short of half a century, or until
about the year 1640.&nbsp; I admit, however, that the evidence for assigning
him so long a life rests solely on the supposed identity of the figure
known as &ldquo;Il Vecchietto,&rdquo; in the Varallo Descent from the
Cross chapel, with the portrait of Tabachetti himself in the Ecce Homo
chapel, also at Varallo.</p>
<p>I find additional reason for thinking the chapels owe their origin
to the inundation of 9th September, 1589, in the fact that the 8th of
September is made a day of pilgrimage to the Saas-F&eacute;e chapels
throughout the whole valley of Saas.&nbsp; It is true the 8th of September
is the festival of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, so that under any
circumstances this would be a great day, but the fact that not only
the people of Saas, but the whole valley down to Visp, flock to this
chapel on the 8th of September, points to the belief that some special
act of grace on the part of the Virgin was vouchsafed on this day in
connection with this chapel.&nbsp; A belief that it was owing to the
intervention of St. Mary of F&eacute;e that the inundation was not attended
with loss of life would be very likely to lead to the foundation of
a series of chapels leading up to the place where her miraculous picture
was placed, and to the more special celebration of her Nativity in connection
with this spot throughout the valley of Saas.&nbsp; I have discussed
the subject with the Rev. Jos.&nbsp; Ant. Ruppen, and he told me he
thought the fact that the great <i>f&ecirc;te</i> of the year in connection
with the Saas-F&eacute;e chapels was on the 8th of September pointed
rather strongly to the supposition that there was a connection between
these and the recorded flood of 9th September, 1589.</p>
<p>Turning to the individual chapels they are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Annunciation.&nbsp; The treatment here presents no more
analogy to that of the same subject at Varallo than is inevitable in
the nature of the subject.&nbsp; The Annunciation figures at Varallo
have proved to be mere draped dummies with wooden heads; Tabachetti,
even though he did the heads, which he very likely did, would take no
interest in the Varallo work with the same subject.&nbsp; The Annunciation,
from its very simplicity as well as from the transcendental nature of
the subject, is singularly hard to treat, and the work here, whatever
it may once have been, is now no longer remarkable.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Salutation of Mary by Elizabeth.&nbsp; This group, again,
bears no analogy to the Salutation chapel at Varallo, in which Tabachetti&rsquo;s
share was so small that it cannot be considered as in any way his.&nbsp;
It is not to be expected, therefore, that the Saas chapel should follow
the Varallo one.&nbsp; The figures, four in number, are pleasing and
well arranged.&nbsp; St. Joseph, St. Elizabeth, and St. Zacharias are
all talking at once.&nbsp; The Virgin is alone silent.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Nativity is much damaged and hard to see.&nbsp; The
treatment bears no analogy to that adopted by Gaudenzio Ferrari at Varallo.&nbsp;
There is one pleasing young shepherd standing against the wall, but
some figures have no doubt (as in others of the chapels) disappeared,
and those that remain have been so shifted from their original positions
that very little idea can be formed of what the group was like when
Tabachetti left it.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Purification.&nbsp; I can hardly say why this chapel
should remind me, as it does, of the Circumcision chapel at Varallo,
for there are more figures here than space at Varallo will allow.&nbsp;
It cannot be pretended that any single figure is of extraordinary merit,
but amongst them they tell their story with excellent effect.&nbsp;
Two, those of St. Joseph and St. Anna (?), that doubtless were once
more important factors in the drama, are now so much in corners near
the window that they can hardly be seen.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Dispute in the Temple.&nbsp; This subject is not treated
at Varallo.&nbsp; Here at Saas there are only six doctors now; whether
or no there were originally more cannot be determined.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The Agony in the Garden.&nbsp; Tabachetti had no chapel
with this subject at Varallo, and there is no resemblance between the
Saas chapel and that by D&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; The figures are no doubt
approximately in their original positions, but I have no confidence
that I have rearranged them correctly.&nbsp; They were in such confusion
when I first saw them that the Rev. E. J. Selwyn and myself determined
to rearrange them.&nbsp; They have doubtless been shifted more than
once since Tabachetti left them.&nbsp; The sleeping figures are all
good.&nbsp; St. James is perhaps a little prosaic.&nbsp; One Roman soldier
who is coming into the garden with a lantern, and motioning silence
with his hand, does duty for the others that are to follow him.&nbsp;
I should think more than one of these figures is actually carved in
wood by Tabachetti, allowance being made for the fact that he was working
in a material with which he was not familiar, and which no sculptor
of the highest rank has ever found congenial.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The Flagellation.&nbsp; Tabachetti has a chapel with this
subject at Varallo, and the Saas group is obviously a descent with modification
from his work there.&nbsp; The figure of Christ is so like the one at
Varallo that I think it must have been carved by Tabachetti himself.&nbsp;
The man with the hooked nose, who at Varallo is stooping to bind his
rods, is here upright: it was probably the intention to emphasize him
in the succeeding scenes as well as this, in the same way as he has
been emphasized at Varallo, but his nose got pared down in the cutting
of later scenes, and could not easily be added to.&nbsp; The man binding
Christ to the column at Varallo is repeated (<i>longo intervallo</i>)
here, and the whole work is one inspired by that at Varallo, though
no single figure except that of the Christ is adhered to with any very
great closeness.&nbsp; I think the nearer malefactor, with a goitre,
and wearing a large black hat, is either an addition of the year 1709,
or was done by the journeyman of the local sculptor who carved the greater
number of the figures.&nbsp; The man stooping down to bind his rods
can hardly be by the same hand as either of the two black-hatted malefactors,
but it is impossible to speak with certainty.&nbsp; The general effect
of the chapel is excellent, if we consider the material in which it
is executed, and the rudeness of the audience to whom it addresses itself.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; The Crowning with Thorns.&nbsp; Here again the inspiration
is derived from Tabachetti&rsquo;s Crowning with Thorns at Varallo.&nbsp;
The Christs in the two chapels are strikingly alike, and the general
effect is that of a residuary impression left in the mind of one who
had known the Varallo Flagellation exceedingly well.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Sta.&nbsp; Veronica.&nbsp; This and the next succeeding
chapels are the most important of the series.&nbsp; Tabachetti&rsquo;s
Journey to Calvary at Varallo is again the source from which the present
work was taken, but, as I have already said, it has been modified in
reproduction.&nbsp; Mount Calvary is still shown, as at Varallo, towards
the left-hand corner of the work, but at Saas it is more towards the
middle than at Varallo, so that horsemen and soldiers may be seen coming
up behind it&mdash;a stroke that deserves the name of genius none the
less for the manifest imperfection with which it has been carried into
execution.&nbsp; There are only three horses fully shown, and one partly
shown.&nbsp; They are all of the heavy Flemish type adopted by Tabachetti
at Varallo.&nbsp; The man kicking the fallen Christ and the goitred
man (with the same teeth missing), who are so conspicuous in the Varallo
Journey to Calvary, reappear here, only the kicking man has much less
nose than at Varallo, probably because (as explained) the nose got whittled
away and could not be whittled back again.&nbsp; I observe that the
kind of lapelled tunic which Tabachetti, and only Tabachetti, adopts
at Varallo, is adopted for the centurion in this chapel, and indeed
throughout the Saas chapels this particular form of tunic is the most
usual for a Roman soldier.&nbsp; The work is still a very striking one,
notwithstanding its translation into wood and the decay into which it
has been allowed to fall; nor can it fail to impress the visitor who
is familiar with this class of art as coming from a man of extraordinary
dramatic power and command over the almost impossible art of composing
many figures together effectively in all-round sculpture.&nbsp; Whether
all the figures are even now as Tabachetti left them I cannot determine,
but Mr. Selwyn has restored Simon the Cyrenian to the position in which
he obviously ought to stand, and between us we have got the chapel into
something more like order.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; The Crucifixion.&nbsp; This subject was treated at Varallo
not by Tabachetti but by Gaudenzio Ferrari.&nbsp; It confirms therefore
my opinion as to the designer of the Saas chapels to find in them no
trace of the Varallo Crucifixion, while the kind of tunic which at Varallo
is only found in chapels wherein Tabachetti worked again appears here.&nbsp;
The work is in a deplorable state of decay.&nbsp; Mr. Selwyn has greatly
improved the arrangement of the figures, but even now they are not,
I imagine, quite as Tabachetti left them.&nbsp; The figure of Christ
is greatly better in technical execution than that of either of the
two thieves; the folds of the drapery alone will show this even to an
unpractised eye.&nbsp; I do not think there can be a doubt but that
Tabachetti cut this figure himself, as also those of the Magdalene and
St. John, who stand at the foot of the cross.&nbsp; The thieves are
coarsely executed, with no very obvious distinction between the penitent
and the impenitent one, except that there is a fiend painted on the
ceiling over the impenitent thief.&nbsp; The one horse introduced into
the composition is again of the heavy Flemish type adopted by Tabachetti
at Varallo.&nbsp; There is great difference in the care with which the
folds on the several draperies have been cut, some being stiff and poor
enough, while others are done very sufficiently.&nbsp; In spite of smallness
of scale, ignoble material, disarrangement and decay, the work is still
striking.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; The Resurrection.&nbsp; There being no chapel at Varallo
with any of the remaining subjects treated at Saas, the sculptor has
struck out a line for himself.&nbsp; The Christ in the Resurrection
Chapel is a carefully modelled figure, and if better painted might not
be ineffective.&nbsp; Three soldiers, one sleeping, alone remain.&nbsp;
There were probably other figures that have been lost.&nbsp; The sleeping
soldier is very pleasing.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; The Ascension is not remarkably interesting; the Christ
appears to be, but perhaps is not, a much more modern figure than the
rest.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; The Descent of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Some of the figures
along the end wall are very good, and were, I should imagine, cut by
Tabachetti himself.&nbsp; Those against the two side walls are not so
well cut.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; The Assumption of the Virgin Mary.&nbsp; The two large
cherubs here are obviously by a later hand, and the small ones are not
good.&nbsp; The figure of the Virgin herself is unexceptionable.&nbsp;
There were doubtless once other figures of the Apostles which have disappeared;
of these a single St. Peter (?), so hidden away in a corner near the
window that it can only be seen with difficulty, is the sole survivor.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; The Coronation of the Virgin is of later date, and has
probably superseded an earlier work.&nbsp; It can hardly be by the designer
of the other chapels of the series.&nbsp; Perhaps Tabachetti had to
leave for Crea before all the chapels at Saas were finished.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have the larger chapel dedicated to St. Mary, which crowns
the series.&nbsp; Here there is nothing of more than common artistic
interest, unless we except the stone altar mentioned in Ruppen&rsquo;s
chronicle.&nbsp; This is of course classical in style, and is, I should
think, very good.</p>
<p>Once more I must caution the reader against expecting to find highly
finished gems of art in the chapels I have been describing.&nbsp; A
wooden figure not more than two feet high clogged with many coats of
paint can hardly claim to be taken very seriously, and even those few
that were cut by Tabachetti himself were not meant to have attention
concentrated on themselves alone.&nbsp; As mere wood-carving the Saas-F&eacute;e
chapels will not stand comparison, for example, with the triptych of
unknown authorship in the Church of St. Anne at Gliss, close to Brieg.&nbsp;
But, in the first place, the work at Gliss is worthy of Holbein himself;
I know no wood-carving that can so rivet the attention; moreover it
is coloured with water-colour and not oil, so that it is tinted, not
painted; and, in the second place, the Gliss triptych belongs to a date
(1519) when artists held neither time nor impressionism as objects,
and hence, though greatly better than the Saas-F&eacute;e chapels as
regards a certain Japanese curiousness of finish and <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>
of literal transcription, it cannot even enter the lists with the Saas
work as regards <i>&eacute;lan</i> and dramatic effectiveness.&nbsp;
The difference between the two classes of work is much that between,
say, John Van Eyck or Memling and Rubens or Rembrandt, or, again, between
Giovanni Bellini and Tintoretto; the aims of the one class of work are
incompatible with those of the other.&nbsp; Moreover, in the Gliss triptych
the intention of the designer is carried out (whether by himself or
no) with admirable skill; whereas at Saas the wisdom of the workman
is rather of Ober-Ammergau than of the Egyptians, and the voice of the
poet is not a little drowned in that of his mouthpiece.&nbsp; If, however,
the reader will bear in mind these somewhat obvious considerations,
and will also remember the pathetic circumstances under which the chapels
were designed&mdash;for Tabachetti when he reached Saas was no doubt
shattered in body and mind by his four years&rsquo; imprisonment&mdash;he
will probably be not less attracted to them than I observed were many
of the visitors both at Saas-Grund and Saas-F&eacute;e with whom I had
the pleasure of examining them.</p>
<p>I will now run briefly through the other principal works in the neighbourhood
to which I think the reader would be glad to have his attention directed.</p>
<p>At Saas-F&eacute;e itself the main altar-piece is without interest,
as also one with a figure of St. Sebastian.&nbsp; The Virgin and Child
above the remaining altar are, so far as I remember them, very good,
and greatly superior to the smaller figures of the same altar-piece.</p>
<p>At Almagel, an hour&rsquo;s walk or so above Saas-Grund&mdash;a village,
the name of which, like those of the Alphubel, the Monte Moro, and more
than one other neighbouring site, is supposed to be of Saracenic origin&mdash;the
main altar-piece represents a female saint with folded arms being beheaded
by a vigorous man to the left.&nbsp; These two figures are very good.&nbsp;
There are two somewhat inferior elders to the right, and the composition
is crowned by the Assumption of the Virgin.&nbsp; I like the work, but
have no idea who did it.&nbsp; Two bishops flanking the composition
are not so good.&nbsp; There are two other altars in the church: the
right-hand one has some pleasing figures, not so the left-hand.</p>
<p>In St. Joseph&rsquo;s Chapel, on the mule-road between Saas-Grund
and Saas-F&eacute;e, the St. Joseph and the two children are rather
nice.&nbsp; In the churches and chapels which I looked into between
Saas and Stalden, I saw many florid extravagant altar-pieces, but nothing
that impressed me favourably.</p>
<p>In the parish church at Saas-Grund there are two altar-pieces which
deserve attention.&nbsp; In the one over the main altar the arrangement
of the Last Supper in a deep recess half-way up the composition is very
pleasing and effective; in that above the right-hand altar of the two
that stand in the body of the church there are a number of round lunettes,
about eight inches in diameter, each containing a small but spirited
group of wooden figures.&nbsp; I have lost my notes on these altar-pieces
and can only remember that the main one has been restored, and now belongs
to two different dates, the earlier date being, I should imagine, about
1670.&nbsp; A similar treatment of the Last Supper may be found near
Brieg in the church of Naters, and no doubt the two altar-pieces are
by the same man.&nbsp; There are, by the way, two very ambitious altars
on either side the main arch leading to the chancel in the church at
Naters, of which the one on the south side contains obvious reminiscences
of Gaudenzio Ferrari&rsquo;s Sta.&nbsp; Maria frescoes at Varallo; but
none of the four altar-pieces in the two transepts tempted me to give
them much attention.&nbsp; As regards the smaller altar-piece at Saas-Grund,
analogous work may be found at Cravagliana, half-way between Varallo
and Fobello, but this last has suffered through the inveterate habit
which Italians have of showing their hatred towards the enemies of Christ
by mutilating the figures that represent them.&nbsp; Whether the Saas
work is by a Valsesian artist who came over to Switzerland, or whether
the Cravagliana work is by a Swiss who had come to Italy, I cannot say
without further consideration and closer examination than I have been
able to give.&nbsp; The altar-pieces of Mairengo, Chiggiogna, and, I
am told, Lavertezzo, all in the Canton Ticino, are by a Swiss or German
artist who has migrated southward; but the reverse migration was equally
common.</p>
<p>Being in the neighbourhood, and wishing to assure myself whether
the sculptor of the Saas-F&eacute;e chapels had or had not come lower
down the valley, I examined every church and village which I could hear
of as containing anything that might throw light on this point.&nbsp;
I was thus led to Vispertimenen, a village some three hours above either
Visp or Stalden.&nbsp; It stands very high, and is an almost untouched
example of a medieval village.&nbsp; The altar-piece of the main church
is even more floridly ambitious in its abundance of carving and gilding
than the many other ambitious altar-pieces with which the Canton Valais
abounds.&nbsp; The Apostles are receiving the Holy Ghost on the first
storey of the composition, and they certainly are receiving it with
an overjoyed alacrity and hilarious ecstasy of <i>allegria spirituale</i>
which it would not be easy to surpass.&nbsp; Above the village, reaching
almost to the limits beyond which there is no cultivation, there stands
a series of chapels like those I have been describing at Saas-F&eacute;e,
only much larger and more ambitious.&nbsp; They are twelve in number,
including the church that crowns the series.&nbsp; The figures they
contain are of wood (so I was assured, but I did not go inside the chapels):
they are life-size, and in some chapels there are as many as a dozen
figures.&nbsp; I should think they belonged to the later half of the
eighteenth century, and here, one would say, sculpture touches the ground;
at least, it is not easy to see how cheap exaggeration can sink an art
more deeply.&nbsp; The only things that at all pleased me were a smiling
donkey and an ecstatic cow in the Nativity chapel.&nbsp; Those who are
not allured by the prospect of seeing perhaps the very worst that can
be done in its own line, need not be at the pains of climbing up to
Vispertimenen.&nbsp; Those, on the other hand, who may find this sufficient
inducement will not be disappointed, and they will enjoy magnificent
views of the Weisshorn and the mountains near the Dom.</p>
<p>I have already referred to the triptych at Gliss.&nbsp; This is figured
in Wolf&rsquo;s work on Chamonix and the Canton Valais, but a larger
and clearer reproduction of such an extraordinary work is greatly to
be desired.&nbsp; The small wooden statues above the triptych, as also
those above its modern companion in the south transept, are not less
admirable than the triptych itself.&nbsp; I know of no other like work
in wood, and have no clue whatever as to who the author can have been
beyond the fact that the work is purely German and eminently Holbeinesque
in character.</p>
<p>I was told of some chapels at Rarogne, five or six miles lower down
the valley than Visp.&nbsp; I examined them, and found they had been
stripped of their figures.&nbsp; The few that remained satisfied me
that we have had no loss.&nbsp; Above Brieg there are two other like
series of chapels.&nbsp; I examined the higher and more promising of
the two, but found not one single figure left.&nbsp; I was told by my
driver that the other series, close to the Pont Napol&eacute;on on the
Simplon road, had been also stripped of its figures, and, there being
a heavy storm at the time, have taken his word for it that this was
so.</p>
<h2>Thought and Language <a name="citation209"></a><a href="#footnote209">{209}</a></h2>
<p>Three well-known writers, Professor Max M&uuml;ller, Professor Mivart,
and Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace, have lately maintained that though the
theory of descent with modification accounts for the development of
all vegetable life, and of all animals lower than man, yet that man
cannot&mdash;not at least in respect of the whole of his nature&mdash;be
held to have descended from any animal lower than himself, inasmuch
as none lower than man possesses even the germs of language.&nbsp; Reason,
it is contended&mdash;more especially by Professor Max M&uuml;ller in
his <i>Science of Thought</i>, to which I propose confining our attention
this evening&mdash;is so inseparably connected with language, that the
two are in point of fact identical; hence it is argued that, as the
lower animals have no germs of language, they can have no germs of reason,
and the inference is drawn that man cannot be conceived as having derived
his own reasoning powers and command of language through descent from
beings in which no germ of either can be found.&nbsp; The relations
therefore between thought and language, interesting in themselves, acquire
additional importance from the fact of their having become the battle-ground
between those who say that the theory of descent breaks down with man,
and those who maintain that we are descended from some apelike ancestor
long since extinct.</p>
<p>The contention of those who refuse to admit man unreservedly into
the scheme of evolution is comparatively recent.&nbsp; The great propounders
of evolution, Buffon, Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck&mdash;not to mention
a score of others who wrote at the close of the last and early part
of this present century&mdash;had no qualms about admitting man into
their system.&nbsp; They have been followed in this respect by the late
Mr. Charles Darwin, and by the greatly more influential part of our
modern biologists, who hold that whatever loss of dignity we may incur
through being proved to be of humble origin, is compensated by the credit
we may claim for having advanced ourselves to such a high pitch of civilization;
this bids us expect still further progress, and glorifies our descendants
more than it abases our ancestors.&nbsp; But to whichever view we may
incline on sentimental grounds the fact remains that, while Charles
Darwin declared language to form no impassable barrier between man and
the lower animals, Professor Max M&uuml;ller calls it the Rubicon which
no brute dare cross, and deduces hence the conclusion that man cannot
have descended from an unknown but certainly speechless ape.</p>
<p>It may perhaps be expected that I should begin a lecture on the relations
between thought and language with some definition of both these things;
but thought, as Sir William Grove said of motion, is a phenomenon &ldquo;so
obvious to simple apprehension that to define it would make it more
obscure.&rdquo; <a name="citation210"></a><a href="#footnote210">{210}</a>&nbsp;
Definitions are useful where things are new to us, but they are superfluous
about those that are already familiar, and mischievous, so far as they
are possible at all, in respect of all those things that enter so profoundly
and intimately into our being that in them we must either live or bear
no life.&nbsp; To vivisect the more vital processes of thought is to
suspend, if not to destroy them; for thought can think about everything
more healthily and easily than about itself.&nbsp; It is like its instrument
the brain, which knows nothing of any injuries inflicted upon itself.&nbsp;
As regards what is new to us, a definition will sometimes dilute a difficulty,
and help us to swallow that which might choke us undiluted; but to define
when we have once well swallowed is to unsettle, rather than settle,
our digestion.&nbsp; Definitions, again, are like steps cut in a steep
slope of ice, or shells thrown on to a greasy pavement; they give us
foothold, and enable us to advance, but when we are at our journey&rsquo;s
end we want them no longer.&nbsp; Again, they are useful as mental fluxes,
and as helping us to fuse new ideas with our older ones.&nbsp; They
present us with some tags and ends of ideas that we have already mastered,
on to which we can hitch our new ones; but to multiply them in respect
of such a matter as thought, is like scratching the bite of a gnat;
the more we scratch the more we want to scratch; the more we define
the more we shall have to go on defining the words we have used in our
definitions, and shall end by setting up a serious mental raw in the
place of a small uneasiness that was after all quite endurable.&nbsp;
We know too well what thought is, to be able to know that we know it,
and I am persuaded there is no one in this room but understands what
is meant by thought and thinking well enough for all the purposes of
this discussion.&nbsp; Whoever does not know this without words will
not learn it for all the words and definitions that are laid before
him.&nbsp; The more, indeed, he hears, the more confused he will become.&nbsp;
I shall, therefore, merely premise that I use the word &ldquo;thought&rdquo;
in the same sense as that in which it is generally used by people who
say that they think this or that.&nbsp; At any rate, it will be enough
if I take Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s own definition, and say
that its essence consists in a bringing together of mental images and
ideas with deductions therefrom, and with a corresponding power of detaching
them from one another.&nbsp; Hobbes, the Professor tells us, maintained
this long ago, when he said that all our thinking consists of addition
and subtraction&mdash;that is to say, in bringing ideas together, and
in detaching them from one another.</p>
<p>Turning from thought to language, we observe that the word is derived
from the French <i>langue</i>, or <i>tongue</i>.&nbsp; Strictly, therefore,
it means <i>tonguage</i>.&nbsp; This, however, takes account of but
a very small part of the ideas that underlie the word.&nbsp; It does,
indeed, seize a familiar and important detail of everyday speech, though
it may be doubted whether the tongue has more to do with speaking than
lips, teeth and throat have, but it makes no attempt at grasping and
expressing the essential characteristic of speech.&nbsp; Anything done
with the tongue, even though it involve no speaking at all, is <i>tonguage</i>;
eating oranges is as much tonguage as speech is.&nbsp; The word, therefore,
though it tells us in part how speech is effected, reveals nothing of
that ulterior meaning which is nevertheless inseparable from any right
use of the words either &ldquo;speech&rdquo; or &ldquo;language.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It presents us with what is indeed a very frequent adjunct of conversation,
but the use of written characters, or the finger-speech of deaf mutes,
is enough to show that the word &ldquo;language&rdquo; omits all reference
to the most essential characteristics of the idea, which in practice
it nevertheless very sufficiently presents to us.&nbsp; I hope presently
to make it clear to you how and why it should do so.&nbsp; The word
is incomplete in the first place, because it omits all reference to
the ideas which words, speech or language are intended to convey, and
there can be no true word without its actually or potentially conveying
an idea.&nbsp; Secondly, it makes no allusion to the person or persons
to whom the ideas are to be conveyed.&nbsp; Language is not language
unless it not only expresses fairly definite and coherent ideas, but
unless it also conveys these ideas to some other living intelligent
being, either man or brute, that can understand them.&nbsp; We may speak
to a dog or horse, but not to a stone.&nbsp; If we make pretence of
doing so we are in reality only talking to ourselves.&nbsp; The person
or animal spoken to is half the battle&mdash;a half, moreover, which
is essential to there being any battle at all.&nbsp; It takes two people
to say a thing&mdash;a sayee as well as a sayer.&nbsp; The one is as
essential to any true saying as the other.&nbsp; A. may have spoken,
but if B. has not heard there has been nothing said, and he must speak
again.&nbsp; True, the belief on A.&rsquo;s part that he had a <i>bona
fide</i> sayee in B., saves his speech <i>qua</i> him, but it has been
barren and left no fertile issue.&nbsp; It has failed to fulfil the
conditions of true speech, which involve not only that A. should speak,
but also that B. should hear.&nbsp; True, again, we often speak of loose,
incoherent, indefinite language; but by doing so we imply, and rightly,
that we are calling that language which is not true language at all.&nbsp;
People, again, sometimes talk to themselves without intending that any
other person should hear them, but this is not well done, and does harm
to those who practise it.&nbsp; It is abnormal, whereas our concern
is with normal and essential characteristics; we may, therefore, neglect
both delirious babblings, and the cases in which a person is regarding
him or herself, as it were, from outside, and treating himself as though
he were someone else.</p>
<p>Inquiring, then, what are the essentials, the presence of which constitutes
language, while their absence negatives it altogether, we find that
Professor Max M&uuml;ller restricts them to the use of grammatical articulate
words that we can write or speak, and denies that anything can be called
language unless it can be written or spoken in articulate words and
sentences.&nbsp; He also denies that we can think at all unless we do
so in words; that is to say, in sentences with verbs and nouns.&nbsp;
Indeed, he goes so far as to say upon his title-page that there can
be no reason&mdash;which I imagine comes to much the same thing as thought&mdash;without
language, and no language without reason.</p>
<p>Against the assertion that there can be no true language without
reason I have nothing to say.&nbsp; But when the Professor says that
there can be no reason, or thought, without language, his opponents
contend, as it seems to me, with greater force, that thought, though
infinitely aided, extended and rendered definite through the invention
of words, nevertheless existed so fully as to deserve no other name
thousands, if not millions of years before words had entered into it
at all.&nbsp; Words, they say, are a comparatively recent invention,
for the fuller expression of something that was already in existence.</p>
<p>Children, they urge, are often evidently thinking and reasoning,
though they can neither think nor speak in words.&nbsp; If you ask me
to define reason, I answer as before that this can no more be done than
thought, truth or motion can be defined.&nbsp; Who has answered the
question, &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo;&nbsp; Man cannot see God and
live.&nbsp; We cannot go so far back upon ourselves as to undermine
our own foundations; if we try to do so we topple over, and lose that
very reason about which we vainly try to reason.&nbsp; If we let the
foundations be, we know well enough that they are there, and we can
build upon them in all security.&nbsp; We cannot, then, define reason
nor crib, cabin and confine it within a thus-far-shalt-thou-go-and-no-further.&nbsp;
Who can define heat or cold, or night or day?&nbsp; Yet, so long as
we hold fast by current consent, our chances of error for want of better
definition are so small that no sensible person will consider them.&nbsp;
In like manner, if we hold by current consent or common sense, which
is the same thing, about reason, we shall not find the want of an academic
definition hinder us from a reasonable conclusion.&nbsp; What nurse
or mother will doubt that her infant child can reason within the limits
of its own experience, long before it can formulate its reason in articulately
worded thought?&nbsp; If the development of any given animal is, as
our opponents themselves admit, an epitome of the history of its whole
anterior development, surely the fact that speech is an accomplishment
acquired after birth so artificially that children who have gone wild
in the woods lose it if they have ever learned it, points to the conclusion
that man&rsquo;s ancestors only learned to express themselves in articulate
language at a comparatively recent period.&nbsp; Granted that they learn
to think and reason continually the more and more fully for having done
so, will common sense permit us to suppose that they could neither think
nor reason at all till they could convey their ideas in words?</p>
<p>I will return later to the reason of the lower animals, but will
now deal with the question what it is that constitutes language in the
most comprehensive sense that can be properly attached to it.&nbsp;
I have said already that language to be language at all must not only
convey fairly definite coherent ideas, but must also convey them to
another living being.&nbsp; Whenever two living beings have conveyed
and received ideas, there has been language, whether looks or gestures
or words spoken or written have been the vehicle by means of which the
ideas have travelled.&nbsp; Some ideas crawl, some run, some fly; and
in this case words are the wings they fly with, but they are only the
wings of thought or of ideas, they are not the thought or ideas themselves,
nor yet, as Professor Max M&uuml;ller would have it, inseparably connected
with them.&nbsp; Last summer I was at an inn in Sicily, where there
was a deaf and dumb waiter; he had been born so, and could neither write
nor read.&nbsp; What had he to do with words or words with him?&nbsp;
Are we to say, then, that this most active, amiable and intelligent
fellow could neither think nor reason?&nbsp; One day I had had my dinner
and had left the hotel.&nbsp; A friend came in, and the waiter saw him
look for me in the place I generally occupied.&nbsp; He instantly came
up to my friend and moved his two forefingers in a way that suggested
two people going about together, this meant &ldquo;your friend&rdquo;;
he then moved his forefingers horizontally across his eyes, this meant,
&ldquo;who wears divided spectacles&rdquo;; he made two fierce marks
over the sockets of his eyes, this meant, &ldquo;with the heavy eyebrows&rdquo;;
he pulled his chin, and then touched his white shirt, to say that my
beard was white.&nbsp; Having thus identified me as a friend of the
person he was speaking to, and as having a white beard, heavy eyebrows,
and wearing divided spectacles, he made a munching movement with his
jaws to say that I had had my dinner; and finally, by making two fingers
imitate walking on the table, he explained that I had gone away.&nbsp;
My friend, however, wanted to know how long I had been gone, so he pulled
out his watch and looked inquiringly.&nbsp; The man at once slapped
himself on the back, and held up the five fingers of one hand, to say
it was five minutes ago.&nbsp; All this was done as rapidly as though
it had been said in words; and my friend, who knew the man well, understood
without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.&nbsp; Are we to say that this man
had no thought, nor reason, nor language, merely because he had not
a single word of any kind in his head, which I am assured he had not;
for, as I have said, he could not speak with his fingers?&nbsp; Is it
possible to deny that a dialogue&mdash;an intelligent conversation&mdash;had
passed between the two men?&nbsp; And if conversation, then surely it
is technical and pedantic to deny that all the essential elements of
language were present.&nbsp; The signs and tokens used by this poor
fellow were as rude an instrument of expression, in comparison with
ordinary language, as going on one&rsquo;s hands and knees is in comparison
with walking, or as walking compared with going by train; but it is
as great an abuse of words to limit the word &ldquo;language&rdquo;
to mere words written or spoken, as it would be to limit the idea of
a locomotive to a railway engine.&nbsp; This may indeed pass in ordinary
conversation, where so much must be suppressed if talk is to be got
through at all, but it is intolerable when we are inquiring about the
relations between thought and words.&nbsp; To do so is to let words
become as it were the masters of thought, on the ground that the fact
of their being only its servants and appendages is so obvious that it
is generally allowed to go without saying.</p>
<p>If all that Professor Max M&uuml;ller means to say is, that no animal
but man commands an articulate language, with verbs and nouns, or is
ever likely to command one (and I question whether in reality he means
much more than this), no one will differ from him.&nbsp; No dog or elephant
has one word for bread, another for meat, and another for water.&nbsp;
Yet, when we watch a cat or dog dreaming, as they often evidently do,
can we doubt that the dream is accompanied by a mental image of the
thing that is dreamed of, much like what we experience in dreams ourselves,
and much doubtless like the mental images which must have passed through
the mind of my deaf and dumb waiter?&nbsp; If they have mental images
in sleep, can we doubt that waking, also, they picture things before
their mind&rsquo;s eyes, and see them much as we do&mdash;too vaguely
indeed to admit of our thinking that we actually see the objects themselves,
but definitely enough for us to be able to recognize the idea or object
of which we are thinking, and to connect it with any other idea, object,
or sign that we may think appropriate?</p>
<p>Here we have touched on the second essential element of language.&nbsp;
We laid it down, that its essence lay in the communication of an idea
from one intelligent being to another; but no ideas can be communicated
at all except by the aid of conventions to which both parties have agreed
to attach an identical meaning.&nbsp; The agreement may be very informal,
and may pass so unconsciously from one generation to another that its
existence can only be recognized by the aid of much introspection, but
it will be always there.&nbsp; A sayer, a sayee, and a convention, no
matter what, agreed upon between them as inseparably attached to the
idea which it is intended to convey&mdash;these comprise all the essentials
of language.&nbsp; Where these are present there is language; where
any of them are wanting there is no language.&nbsp; It is not necessary
for the sayee to be able to speak and become a sayer.&nbsp; If he comprehends
the sayer&mdash;that is to say, if he attaches the same meaning to a
certain symbol as the sayer does&mdash;if he is a party to the bargain
whereby it is agreed upon by both that any given symbol shall be attached
invariably to a certain idea, so that in virtue of the principle of
associated ideas the symbol shall never be present without immediately
carrying the idea along with it, then all the essentials of language
are complied with, and there has been true speech though never a word
was spoken.</p>
<p>The lower animals, therefore, many of them, possess a part of our
own language, though they cannot speak it, and hence do not possess
it so fully as we do.&nbsp; They cannot say &ldquo;bread,&rdquo; &ldquo;meat,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;water,&rdquo; but there are many that readily learn what ideas
they ought to attach to these symbols when they are presented to them.&nbsp;
It is idle to say that a cat does not know what the cat&rsquo;s-meat
man means when he says &ldquo;meat.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cat knows just
as well, neither better nor worse than the cat&rsquo;s-meat man does,
and a great deal better than I myself understand much that is said by
some very clever people at Oxford or Cambridge.&nbsp; There is more
true employment of language, more <i>bona fide</i> currency of speech,
between a sayer and a sayee who understand each other, though neither
of them can speak a word, than between a sayer who can speak with the
tongues of men and of angels without being clear about his own meaning,
and a sayee who can himself utter the same words, but who is only in
imperfect agreement with the sayer as to the ideas which the words or
symbols that he utters are intended to convey.&nbsp; The nature of the
symbols counts for nothing; the gist of the matter is in the perfect
harmony between sayer and sayee as to the significance that is to be
associated with them.</p>
<p>Professor Max M&uuml;ller admits that we share with the lower animals
what he calls an emotional language, and continues that we may call
their interjections and imitations language if we like, as we speak
of the language of the eyes or the eloquence of mute nature, but he
warns us against mistaking metaphor for fact.&nbsp; It is indeed mere
metaphor to talk of the eloquence of mute nature, or the language of
winds and waves.&nbsp; There is no intercommunion of mind with mind
by means of a covenanted symbol; but it is only an apparent, not a real,
metaphor to say that two pairs of eyes have spoken when they have signalled
to one another something which they both understand.&nbsp; A schoolboy
at home for the holidays wants another plate of pudding, and does not
like to apply officially for more.&nbsp; He catches the servant&rsquo;s
eye and looks at the pudding; the servant understands, takes his plate
without a word, and gets him some.&nbsp; Is it metaphor to say that
the boy asked the servant to do this, or is it not rather pedantry to
insist on the letter of a bond and deny its spirit, by denying that
language passed, on the ground that the symbols covenanted upon and
assented to by both were uttered and received by eyes and not by mouth
and ears?&nbsp; When the lady drank to the gentleman only with her eyes,
and he pledged with his, was there no conversation because there was
neither noun nor verb?&nbsp; Eyes are verbs, and glasses of wine are
good nouns enough as between those who understand one another.&nbsp;
Whether the ideas underlying them are expressed and conveyed by eyeage
or by tonguage is a detail that matters nothing.</p>
<p>But everything we say is metaphorical if we choose to be captious.&nbsp;
Scratch the simplest expressions, and you will find the metaphor.&nbsp;
Written words are handage, inkage and paperage; it is only by metaphor,
or substitution and transposition of ideas, that we can call them language.&nbsp;
They are indeed potential language, and the symbols employed presuppose
nouns, verbs, and the other parts of speech; but for the most part it
is in what we read between the lines that the profounder meaning of
any letter is conveyed.&nbsp; There are words unwritten and untranslatable
into any nouns that are nevertheless felt as above, about and underneath
the gross material symbols that lie scrawled upon the paper; and the
deeper the feeling with which anything is written the more pregnant
will it be of meaning which can be conveyed securely enough, but which
loses rather than gains if it is squeezed into a sentence, and limited
by the parts of speech.&nbsp; The language is not in the words but in
the heart-to-heartness of the thing, which is helped by words, but is
nearer and farther than they.&nbsp; A correspondent wrote to me once,
many years ago, &ldquo;If I could think to you without words you would
understand me better.&rdquo;&nbsp; But surely in this he was thinking
to me, and without words, and I did understand him better. . . .&nbsp;
So it is not by the words that I am too presumptuously venturing to
speak to-night that your opinions will be formed or modified.&nbsp;
They will be formed or modified, if either, by something that you will
feel, but which I have not spoken, to the full as much as by anything
that I have actually uttered.&nbsp; You may say that this borders on
mysticism.&nbsp; Perhaps it does, but there really is some mysticism
in nature.</p>
<p>To return, however, to <i>terra firma</i>.&nbsp; I believe I am right
in saying that the essence of language lies in the intentional conveyance
of ideas from one living being to another through the instrumentality
of arbitrary tokens or symbols agreed upon and understood by both as
being associated with the particular ideas in question.&nbsp; The nature
of the symbol chosen is a matter of indifference; it may be anything
that appeals to human senses, and is not too hot or too heavy; the essence
of the matter lies in a mutual covenant that whatever it is shall stand
invariably for the same thing, or nearly so.</p>
<p>We shall see this more easily if we observe the differences between
written and spoken language.&nbsp; The written word &ldquo;stone,&rdquo;
and the spoken word, are each of them symbols arrived at in the first
instance arbitrarily.&nbsp; They are neither of them more like the other
than they are to the idea of a stone which rises before our minds, when
we either see or hear the word, or than this idea again is like the
actual stone itself, but nevertheless the spoken symbol and the written
one each alike convey with certainty the combination of ideas to which
we have agreed to attach them.</p>
<p>The written symbol is formed with the hand, appeals to the eye, leaves
a material trace as long as paper and ink last, can travel as far as
paper and ink can travel, and can be imprinted on eye after eye practically
<i>ad infinitum</i> both as regards time and space.</p>
<p>The spoken symbol is formed by means of various organs in or about
the mouth, appeals to the ear, not the eye, perishes instantly without
material trace, and if it lives at all does so only in the minds of
those who heard it.&nbsp; The range of its action is no wider than that
within which a voice can be heard; and every time a fresh impression
is wanted the type must be set up anew.</p>
<p>The written symbol extends infinitely, as regards time and space,
the range within which one mind can communicate with another; it gives
the writer&rsquo;s mind a life limited by the duration of ink, paper
and readers, as against that of his flesh and blood body.&nbsp; On the
other hand, it takes longer to learn the rules so as to be able to apply
them with ease and security, and even then they cannot be applied so
quickly and easily as those attaching to spoken symbols.&nbsp; Moreover,
the spoken symbols admit of a hundred quick and subtle adjuncts by way
of action, tone and expression, so that no one will use written symbols
unless either for the special advantages of permanence and travelling
power, or because he is incapacitated from using spoken ones.&nbsp;
This, however, is hardly to the point; the point is that these two conventional
combinations of symbols, that are as unlike one another as the Hallelujah
Chorus is to St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, are the one as much language
as the other; and we therefore inquire what this very patent fact reveals
to us about the more essential characteristics of language itself.&nbsp;
What is the common bond that unites these two classes of symbols that
seem at first sight to have nothing in common, and makes the one raise
the idea of language in our minds as readily as the other?&nbsp; The
bond lies in the fact that both are a set of conventional tokens or
symbols, agreed upon between the parties to whom they appeal as being
attached invariably to the same ideas, and because they are being made
as a means of communion between one mind and another&mdash;for a memorandum
made for a person&rsquo;s own later use is nothing but a communication
from an earlier mind to a later and modified one; it is therefore in
reality a communication from one mind to another as much as though it
had been addressed to another person.</p>
<p>We see, therefore, that the nature of the outward and visible sign
to which the inward and spiritual idea of language is attached does
not matter.&nbsp; It may be the firing of a gun; it may be an old semaphore
telegraph; it may be the movements of a needle; a look, a gesture, the
breaking of a twig by an Indian to tell someone that he has passed that
way: a twig broken designedly with this end in view is a letter addressed
to whomsoever it may concern, as much as though it had been written
out in full on bark or paper.&nbsp; It does not matter one straw what
it is, provided it is agreed upon in concert, and stuck to.&nbsp; Just
as the lowest forms of life nevertheless present us with all the essential
characteristics of livingness, and are as much alive in their own humble
way as the most highly developed organisms, so the rudest intentional
and effectual communication between two minds through the instrumentality
of a concerted symbol is as much language as the most finished oratory
of Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; I demur therefore to the assertion that the
lower animals have no language, inasmuch as they cannot themselves articulate
a grammatical sentence.&nbsp; I do not indeed pretend that when the
cat calls upon the tiles it uses what it consciously and introspectively
recognizes as language; it says what it has to say without introspection,
and in the ordinary course of business, as one of the common forms of
courtship.&nbsp; It no more knows that it has been using language than
M. Jourdain knew he had been speaking prose, but M. Jourdain&rsquo;s
knowing or not knowing was neither here nor there.</p>
<p>Anything which can be made to hitch on invariably to a definite idea
that can carry some distance&mdash;say an inch at the least, and which
can be repeated at pleasure, can be pressed into the service of language.&nbsp;
Mrs. Bentley, wife of the famous Dr. Bentley of Trinity College, Cambridge,
used to send her snuff-box to the college buttery when she wanted beer,
instead of a written order.&nbsp; If the snuff-box came the beer was
sent, but if there was no snuff-box there was no beer.&nbsp; Wherein
did the snuff-box differ more from a written order, than a written order
differs from a spoken one?&nbsp; The snuff-box was for the time being
language.&nbsp; It sounds strange to say that one might take a pinch
of snuff out of a sentence, but if the servant had helped him or herself
to a pinch while carrying it to the buttery this is what would have
been done; for if a snuff-box can say &ldquo;Send me a quart of beer,&rdquo;
so efficiently that the beer is sent, it is impossible to say that it
is not a <i>bona fide</i> sentence.&nbsp; As for the recipient of the
message, the butler did not probably translate the snuff-box into articulate
nouns and verbs; as soon as he saw it he just went down into the cellar
and drew the beer, and if he thought at all, it was probably about something
else.&nbsp; Yet he must have been thinking without words, or he would
have drawn too much beer or too little, or have spilt it in the bringing
it up, and we may be sure that he did none of these things.</p>
<p>You will, of course, observe that if Mrs. Bentley had sent the snuff-box
to the buttery of St. John&rsquo;s College instead of Trinity, it would
not have been language, for there would have been no covenant between
sayer and sayee as to what the symbol should represent, there would
have been no previously established association of ideas in the mind
of the butler of St. John&rsquo;s between beer and snuff-box; the connection
was artificial, arbitrary, and by no means one of those in respect of
which an impromptu bargain might be proposed by the very symbol itself,
and assented to without previous formality by the person to whom it
was presented.&nbsp; More briefly, the butler of St. John&rsquo;s would
not have been able to understand and read it aright.&nbsp; It would
have been a dead letter to him&mdash;a snuff-box and not a letter; whereas
to the butler of Trinity it was a letter and not a snuff-box.&nbsp;
You will also note that it was only at the moment when he was looking
at it and accepting it as a message that it flashed forth from snuff-box-hood
into the light and life of living utterance.&nbsp; As soon as it had
kindled the butler into sending a single quart of beer, its force was
spent until Mrs. Bentley threw her soul into it again and charged it
anew by wanting more beer, and sending it down accordingly.</p>
<p>Again, take the ring which the Earl of Essex sent to Queen Elizabeth,
but which the queen did not receive.&nbsp; This was intended as a sentence,
but failed to become effectual language because the sensible material
symbol never reached those sentient organs which it was intended to
affect.&nbsp; A book, again, however full of excellent words it may
be, is not language when it is merely standing on a bookshelf.&nbsp;
It speaks to no one, unless when being actually read, or quoted from
by an act of memory.&nbsp; It is potential language as a lucifer-match
is potential fire, but it is no more language till it is in contact
with a recipient mind, than a match is fire till it is struck, and is
being consumed.</p>
<p>A piece of music, again, without any words at all, or a song with
words that have nothing in the world to do with the ideas which it is
nevertheless made to convey, is very often effectual language.&nbsp;
Much lying, and all irony depends on tampering with covenanted symbols,
and making those that are usually associated with one set of ideas convey
by a sleight of mind others of a different nature.&nbsp; That is why
irony is intolerably fatiguing unless very sparingly used.&nbsp; Take
the song which Blondel sang under the window of King Richard&rsquo;s
prison.&nbsp; There was not one syllable in it to say that Blondel was
there, and was going to help the king to get out of prison.&nbsp; It
was about some silly love affair, but it was a letter all the same,
and the king made language of what would otherwise have been no language,
by guessing the meaning, that is to say, by perceiving that he was expected
to enter then and there into a new covenant as to the meaning of the
symbols that were presented to him, understanding what this covenant
was to be, and acquiescing in it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no ingenuity can torture &ldquo;language&rdquo;
into being a fit word to use in connection with either sounds or any
other symbols that have not been intended to convey a meaning, or again
in connection with either sounds or symbols in respect of which there
has been no covenant between sayer and sayee.&nbsp; When we hear people
speaking a foreign language&mdash;we will say Welsh&mdash;we feel that
though they are no doubt using what is very good language as between
themselves, there is no language whatever as far as we are concerned.&nbsp;
We call it lingo, not language.&nbsp; The Chinese letters on a tea-chest
might as well not be there, for all that they say to us, though the
Chinese find them very much to the purpose.&nbsp; They are a covenant
to which we have been no parties&mdash;to which our intelligence has
affixed no signature.</p>
<p>We have already seen that it is in virtue of such an understood covenant
that symbols so unlike one another as the written word &ldquo;stone&rdquo;
and the spoken word alike at once raise the idea of a stone in our minds.&nbsp;
See how the same holds good as regards the different languages that
pass current in different nations.&nbsp; The letters p, i, e, r, r,
e convey the idea of a stone to a Frenchman as readily as s, t, o, n,
e do to ourselves.&nbsp; And why? because that is the covenant that
has been struck between those who speak and those who are spoken to.&nbsp;
Our &ldquo;stone&rdquo; conveys no idea to a Frenchman, nor his &ldquo;pierre&rdquo;
to us, unless we have done what is commonly called acquiring one another&rsquo;s
language.&nbsp; To acquire a foreign language is only to learn and adhere
to the covenants in respect of symbols which the nation in question
has adopted and adheres to.&nbsp; Till we have done this we neither
of us know the rules, so to speak, of the game that the other is playing,
and cannot, therefore, play together; but the convention being once
known and consented to, it does not matter whether we raise the idea
of a stone by the words &ldquo;lapis,&rdquo; or by &ldquo;lithos,&rdquo;
&ldquo;pietra,&rdquo; &ldquo;pierre,&rdquo; &ldquo;stein,&rdquo; &ldquo;stane&rdquo;
or &ldquo;stone&rdquo;; we may choose what symbols written or spoken
we choose, and one set, unless they are of unwieldy length, will do
as well as another, if we can get other people to choose the same and
stick to them; it is the accepting and sticking to them that matters,
not the symbols.&nbsp; The whole power of spoken language is vested
in the invariableness with which certain symbols are associated with
certain ideas.&nbsp; If we are strict in always connecting the same
symbols with the same ideas, we speak well, keep our meaning clear to
ourselves, and convey it readily and accurately to anyone who is also
fairly strict.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, we use the same combination
of symbols for one thing one day and for another the next, we abuse
our symbols instead of using them, and those who indulge in slovenly
habits in this respect ere long lose the power alike of thinking and
of expressing themselves correctly.&nbsp; The symbols, however, in the
first instance, may be anything in the wide world that we have a fancy
for.&nbsp; They have no more to do with the ideas they serve to convey
than money has with the things that it serves to buy.</p>
<p>The principle of association, as everyone knows, involves that whenever
two things have been associated sufficiently together, the suggestion
of one of them to the mind shall immediately raise a suggestion of the
other.&nbsp; It is in virtue of this principle that language, as we
so call it, exists at all, for the essence of language consists, as
I have said perhaps already too often, in the fixity with which certain
ideas are invariably connected with certain symbols.&nbsp; But this
being so, it is hard to see how we can deny that the lower animals possess
the germs of a highly rude and unspecialized, but still true language,
unless we also deny that they have any ideas at all; and this I gather
is what Professor Max M&uuml;ller in a quiet way rather wishes to do.&nbsp;
Thus he says, &ldquo;It is easy enough to show that animals communicate,
but this is a fact which has never been doubted.&nbsp; Dogs who growl
and bark leave no doubt in the minds of other dogs or cats, or even
of man, of what they mean, but growling and barking are not language,
nor do they even contain the elements of language.&rdquo; <a name="citation230"></a><a href="#footnote230">{230}</a></p>
<p>I observe the Professor says that animals communicate without saying
what it is that they communicate.&nbsp; I believe this to have been
because if he said that the lower animals communicate their ideas, this
would be to admit that they have ideas; if so, and if, as they present
every appearance of doing, they can remember, reflect upon, modify these
ideas according to modified surroundings, and interchange them with
one another, how is it possible to deny them the germs of thought, language,
and reason&mdash;not to say a good deal more than the germs?&nbsp; It
seems to me that not knowing what else to say that animals communicated
if it was not ideas, and not knowing what mess he might not get into
if he admitted that they had ideas at all, he thought it safer to omit
his accusative case altogether.</p>
<p>That growling and barking cannot be called a very highly specialized
language goes without saying; they are, however, so much diversified
in character, according to circumstances, that they place a considerable
number of symbols at an animal&rsquo;s command, and he invariably attaches
the same symbol to the same idea.&nbsp; A cat never purrs when she is
angry, nor spits when she is pleased.&nbsp; When she rubs her head against
anyone affectionately it is her symbol for saying that she is very fond
of him, and she expects, and usually finds that it will be understood.&nbsp;
If she sees her mistress raise her hand as though to pretend to strike
her, she knows that it is the symbol her mistress invariably attaches
to the idea of sending her away, and as such she accepts it.&nbsp; Granted
that the symbols in use among the lower animals are fewer and less highly
differentiated than in the case of any known human language, and therefore
that animal language is incomparably less subtle and less capable of
expressing delicate shades of meaning than our own, these differences
are nevertheless only those that exist between highly developed and
inchoate language; they do not involve those that distinguish language
from no language.&nbsp; They are the differences between the undifferentiated
protoplasm of the am&oelig;ba and our own complex organization; they
are not the differences between life and no life.&nbsp; In animal language
as much as in human there is a mind intentionally making use of a symbol
accepted by another mind as invariably attached to a certain idea, in
order to produce that idea in the mind which it is desired to affect&mdash;more
briefly, there is a sayer, a sayee, and a covenanted symbol designedly
applied.&nbsp; Our own speech is vertebrated and articulated by means
of nouns, verbs, and the rules of grammar.&nbsp; A dog&rsquo;s speech
is invertebrate, but I do not see how it is possible to deny that it
possesses all the essential elements of language.</p>
<p>I have said nothing about Professor R. L. Garner&rsquo;s researches
into the language of apes, because they have not yet been so far verified
and accepted as to make it safe to rely upon them; but when he lays
it down that all voluntary sounds are the products of thought, and that,
if they convey a meaning to another, they perform the functions of human
speech, he says what I believe will commend itself to any unsophisticated
mind.&nbsp; I could have wished, however, that he had not limited himself
to sounds, and should have preferred his saying what I doubt not he
would readily accept&mdash;I mean, that all symbols or tokens of whatever
kind, if voluntarily adopted as such, are the products of thought, and
perform the functions of human speech; but I cannot too often remind
you that nothing can be considered as fulfilling the conditions of language,
except a voluntary application of a recognized token in order to convey
a more or less definite meaning, with the intention doubtless of thus
purchasing as it were some other desired meaning and consequent sensation.&nbsp;
It is astonishing how closely in this respect money and words resemble
one another.&nbsp; Money indeed may be considered as the most universal
and expressive of all languages.&nbsp; For gold and silver coins are
no more money when not in the actual process of being voluntarily used
in purchase, than words not so in use are language.&nbsp; Pounds, shillings
and pence are recognized covenanted tokens, the outward and visible
signs of an inward and spiritual purchasing power, but till in actual
use they are only potential money, as the symbols of language, whatever
they may be, are only potential language till they are passing between
two minds.&nbsp; It is the power and will to apply the symbols that
alone gives life to money, and as long as these are in abeyance the
money is in abeyance also; the coins may be safe in one&rsquo;s pocket,
but they are as dead as a log till they begin to burn in it, and so
are our words till they begin to burn within us.</p>
<p>The real question, however, as to the substantial underlying identity
between the language of the lower animals and our own, turns upon that
other question whether or no, in spite of an immeasurable difference
of degree, the thought and reason of man and of the lower animals is
essentially the same.&nbsp; No one will expect a dog to master and express
the varied ideas that are incessantly arising in connection with human
affairs.&nbsp; He is a pauper as against a millionaire.&nbsp; To ask
him to do so would be like giving a street-boy sixpence and telling
him to go and buy himself a founder&rsquo;s share in the New River Company.&nbsp;
He would not even know what was meant, and even if he did it would take
several millions of sixpences to buy one.</p>
<p>It is astonishing what a clever workman will do with very modest
tools, or again how far a thrifty housewife will make a very small sum
of money go, or again in like manner how many ideas an intelligent brute
can receive and convey with its very limited vocabulary; but no one
will pretend that a dog&rsquo;s intelligence can ever reach the level
of a man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; What we do maintain is that, within its own
limited range, it is of the same essential character as our own, and
that though a dog&rsquo;s ideas in respect of human affairs are both
vague and narrow, yet in respect of canine affairs they are precise
enough and extensive enough to deserve no other name than thought or
reason.&nbsp; We hold moreover that they communicate their ideas in
essentially the same manner as we do&mdash;that is to say, by the instrumentality
of a code of symbols attached to certain states of mind and material
objects, in the first instance arbitrarily, but so persistently, that
the presentation of the symbol immediately carries with it the idea
which it is intended to convey.&nbsp; Animals can thus receive and impart
ideas on all that most concerns them.&nbsp; As my great namesake said
some two hundred years ago, they know &ldquo;what&rsquo;s what, and
that&rsquo;s as high as metaphysic wit can fly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they
not only know what&rsquo;s what themselves, but can impart to one another
any new what&rsquo;s-whatness that they may have acquired, for they
are notoriously able to instruct and correct one another.</p>
<p>Against this Professor Max M&uuml;ller contends that we can know
nothing of what goes on in the mind of any lower animal, inasmuch as
we are not lower animals ourselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can imagine anything
we like about what passes in the mind of an animal,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;we can know absolutely nothing.&rdquo; <a name="citation234"></a><a href="#footnote234">{234}</a>&nbsp;
It is something to have it in evidence that he conceives animals as
having a mind at all, but it is not easy to see how they can be supposed
to have a mind, without being able to acquire ideas, and having acquired,
to read, mark, learn and inwardly digest them.&nbsp; Surely the mistake
of requiring too much evidence is hardly less great than that of being
contented with too little.&nbsp; We, too, are animals, and can no more
refuse to infer reason from certain visible actions in their case than
we can in our own.&nbsp; If Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s plea were
allowed, we should have to deny our right to infer confidently what
passes in the mind of anyone not ourselves, inasmuch as we are not that
person.&nbsp; We never, indeed, can obtain irrefragable certainty about
this or any other matter, but we can be sure enough in many cases to
warrant our staking all that is most precious to us on the soundness
of our opinion.&nbsp; Moreover, if the Professor denies our right to
infer that animals reason, on the ground that we are not animals enough
ourselves to be able to form an opinion, with what right does he infer
so confidently himself that they do not reason?&nbsp; And how, if they
present every one of those appearances which we are accustomed to connect
with the communication of an idea from one mind to another, can we deny
that they have a language of their own, though it is one which in most
cases we can neither speak nor understand?&nbsp; How can we say that
a sentinel rook, when it sees a man with a gun and warns the other rooks
by a concerted note which they all show that they understand by immediately
taking flight, should not be credited both with reason and the germs
of language?</p>
<p>After all, a professor, whether of philology, psychology, biology,
or any other ology, is hardly the kind of person to whom we should appeal
on such an elementary question as that of animal intelligence and language.&nbsp;
We might as well ask a botanist to tell us whether grass grows, or a
meteorologist to tell us if it has left off raining.&nbsp; If it is
necessary to appeal to anyone, I should prefer the opinion of an intelligent
gamekeeper to that of any professor, however learned.&nbsp; The keepers,
again, at the Zoological Gardens, have exceptional opportunities for
studying the minds of animals&mdash;modified, indeed, by captivity,
but still minds of animals.&nbsp; Grooms, again, and dog-fanciers, are
to the full as able to form an intelligent opinion on the reason and
language of animals as any University Professor, and so are cat&rsquo;s-meat
men.&nbsp; I have repeatedly asked gamekeepers and keepers at the Zoological
Gardens whether animals could reason and converse with one another,
and have always found myself regarded somewhat contemptuously for having
even asked the question.&nbsp; I once said to a friend, in the hearing
of a keeper at the Zoological Gardens, that the penguin was very stupid.&nbsp;
The man was furious, and jumped upon me at once.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
not stupid at all,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s very intelligent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who has not seen a cat, when it wishes to go out, raise its fore
paws on to the handle of the door, or as near as it can get, and look
round, evidently asking someone to turn it for her?&nbsp; Is it reasonable
to deny that a reasoning process is going on in the cat&rsquo;s mind,
whereby she connects her wish with the steps necessary for its fulfilment,
and also with certain invariable symbols which she knows her master
or mistress will interpret?&nbsp; Once, in company with a friend, I
watched a cat playing with a house-fly in the window of a ground-floor
room.&nbsp; We were in the street, while the cat was inside.&nbsp; When
we came up to the window she gave us one searching look, and, having
satisfied herself that we had nothing for her, went on with her game.&nbsp;
She knew all about the glass in the window, and was sure we could do
nothing to molest her, so she treated us with absolute contempt, never
even looking at us again.</p>
<p>The game was this.&nbsp; She was to catch the fly and roll it round
and round under her paw along the window-sill, but so gently as not
to injure it nor prevent it from being able to fly again when she had
done rolling it.&nbsp; It was very early spring, and flies were scarce,
in fact there was not another in the whole window.&nbsp; She knew that
if she crippled this one, it would not be able to amuse her further,
and that she would not readily get another instead, and she liked the
feel of it under her paw.&nbsp; It was soft and living, and the quivering
of its wings tickled the ball of her foot in a manner that she found
particularly grateful; so she rolled it gently along the whole length
of the window-sill.&nbsp; It then became the fly&rsquo;s turn.&nbsp;
He was to get up and fly about in the window, so as to recover himself
a little; then she was to catch him again, and roll him softly all along
the window-sill, as she had done before.</p>
<p>It was plain that the cat knew the rules of her game perfectly well,
and enjoyed it keenly.&nbsp; It was equally plain that the fly could
not make head or tail of what it was all about.&nbsp; If it had been
able to do so it would have gone to play in the upper part of the window,
where the cat could not reach it.&nbsp; Perhaps it was always hoping
to get through the glass, and escape that way; anyhow, it kept pretty
much to the same pane, no matter how often it was rolled.&nbsp; At last,
however, the fly, for some reason or another, did not reappear on the
pane, and the cat began looking everywhere to find it.&nbsp; Her annoyance
when she failed to do so was extreme.&nbsp; It was not only that she
had lost her fly, but that she could not conceive how she should have
ever come to do so.&nbsp; Presently she noted a small knot in the woodwork
of the sill, and it flashed upon her that she had accidentally killed
the fly, and that this was its dead body.&nbsp; She tried to move it
gently with her paw, but it was no use, and for the time she satisfied
herself that the knot and the fly had nothing to do with one another.&nbsp;
Every now and then, however, she returned to it as though it were the
only thing she could think of, and she would try it again.&nbsp; She
seemed to say she was certain there had been no knot there before&mdash;she
must have seen it if there had been; and yet, the fly could hardly have
got jammed so firmly into the wood.&nbsp; She was puzzled and irritated
beyond measure, and kept looking in the same place again and again,
just as we do when we have mislaid something.&nbsp; She was rapidly
losing temper and dignity when suddenly we saw the fly reappear from
under the cat&rsquo;s stomach and make for the window-pane, at the very
moment when the cat herself was exclaiming for the fiftieth time that
she wondered where that stupid fly ever could have got to.&nbsp; No
man who has been hunting twenty minutes for his spectacles could be
more delighted when he suddenly finds them on his own forehead.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where you were,&rdquo; we seemed to hear her
say, as she proceeded to catch it, and again began rolling it very softly
without hurting it, under her paw.</p>
<p>My friend and I both noticed that the cat, in spite of her perplexity,
never so much as hinted that we were the culprits.&nbsp; The question
whether anything outside the window could do her good or harm had long
since been settled by her in the negative, and she was not going to
reopen it; she simply cut us dead, and though her annoyance was so great
that she was manifestly ready to lay the blame on anybody or anything
with or without reason, and though she must have perfectly well known
that we were watching the whole affair with amusement, she never either
asked us if we had happened to see such a thing as a fly go down our
way lately, or accused us of having taken it from her&mdash;both of
which ideas she would, I am confident, have been very well able to convey
to us if she had been so minded.</p>
<p>Now what are thought and reason if the processes that were going
through this cat&rsquo;s mind were not both one and the other?&nbsp;
It would be childish to suppose that the cat thought in words of its
own, or in anything like words.&nbsp; Its thinking was probably conducted
through the instrumentality of a series of mental images.&nbsp; We so
habitually think in words ourselves that we find it difficult to realize
thought without words at all; our difficulty, however, in imagining
the particular manner in which the cat thinks has nothing to do with
the matter.&nbsp; We must answer the question whether she thinks or
no, not according to our own ease or difficulty in understanding the
particular manner of her thinking, but according as her action does
or does not appear to be of the same character as other action that
we commonly call thoughtful.&nbsp; To say that the cat is not intelligent,
merely on the ground that we cannot ourselves fathom her intelligence&mdash;this,
as I have elsewhere said, is to make intelligence mean the power of
being understood, rather than the power of understanding.&nbsp; This
nevertheless is what, for all our boasted intelligence, we generally
do.&nbsp; The more we can understand an animal&rsquo;s ways, the more
intelligent we call it, and the less we can understand these, the more
stupid do we declare it to be.&nbsp; As for plants&mdash;whose punctuality
and attention to all the details and routine of their somewhat restricted
lines of business is as obvious as it is beyond all praise&mdash;we
understand the working of their minds so little that by common consent
we declare them to have no intelligence at all.</p>
<p>Before concluding I should wish to deal a little more fully with
Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s contention that there can be no reason
without language, and no language without reason.&nbsp; Surely when
two practised pugilists are fighting, parrying each other&rsquo;s blows,
and watching keenly for an unguarded point, they are thinking and reasoning
very subtly the whole time, without doing so in words.&nbsp; The machination
of their thoughts, as well as its expression, is actual&mdash;I mean,
effectuated and expressed by action and deed, not words.&nbsp; They
are unaware of any logical sequence of thought that they could follow
in words as passing through their minds at all.&nbsp; They may perhaps
think consciously in words now and again, but such thought will be intermittent,
and the main part of the fighting will be done without any internal
concomitance of articulated phrases.&nbsp; Yet we cannot doubt that
their action, however much we may disapprove of it, is guided by intelligence
and reason; nor should we doubt that a reasoning process of the same
character goes on in the minds of two dogs or fighting-cocks when they
are striving to master their opponents.</p>
<p>Do we think in words, again, when we wind up our watches, put on
our clothes, or eat our breakfasts?&nbsp; If we do, it is generally
about something else.&nbsp; We do these things almost as much without
the help of words as we wink or yawn, or perform any of those other
actions that we call reflex, as it would almost seem because they are
done without reflection.&nbsp; They are not, however, the less reasonable
because wordless.</p>
<p>Even when we think we are thinking in words, we do so only in half
measure.&nbsp; A running accompaniment of words no doubt frequently
attends our thoughts; but, unless we are writing or speaking, this accompaniment
is of the vaguest and most fitful kind, as we often find out when we
try to write down or say what we are thinking about, though we have
a fairly definite notion of it, or fancy that we have one, all the time.&nbsp;
The thought is not steadily and coherently governed by and moulded in
words, nor does it steadily govern them.&nbsp; Words and thought interact
upon and help one another, as any other mechanical appliances interact
on and help the invention that first hit upon them; but reason or thought,
for the most part, flies along over the heads of words, working its
own mysterious way in paths that are beyond our ken, though whether
some of our departmental personalities are as unconscious of what is
passing, as that central government is which we alone dub with the name
of &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;us,&rdquo; is a point on which I will
not now touch.</p>
<p>I cannot think, then, that Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s contention
that thought and language are identical&mdash;and he has repeatedly
affirmed this&mdash;will ever be generally accepted.&nbsp; Thought is
no more identical with language than feeling is identical with the nervous
system.&nbsp; True, we can no more feel without a nervous system than
we can discern certain minute organisms without a microscope.&nbsp;
Destroy the nervous system, and we destroy feeling.&nbsp; Destroy the
microscope, and we can no longer see the animalcules; but our sight
of the animalcules is not the microscope, though it is effectuated by
means of the microscope, and our feeling is not the nervous system,
though the nervous system is the instrument that enables us to feel.</p>
<p>The nervous system is a device which living beings have gradually
perfected&mdash;I believe I may say quite truly&mdash;through the will
and power which they have derived from a fountain-head, the existence
of which we can infer, but which we can never apprehend.&nbsp; By the
help of this device, and in proportion as they have perfected it, living
beings feel ever with great definiteness, and hence formulate their
feelings in thought with more and more precision.&nbsp; The higher evolution
of thought has reacted on the nervous system, and the consequent higher
evolution of the nervous system has again reacted upon thought.&nbsp;
These things are as power and desire, or supply and demand, each one
of which is continually outstripping, and being in turn outstripped
by the other; but, in spite of their close connection and interaction,
power is not desire, nor demand supply.&nbsp; Language is a device evolved
sometimes by leaps and bounds, and sometimes exceedingly slowly, whereby
we help ourselves alike to greater ease, precision, and complexity of
thought, and also to more convenient interchange of thought among ourselves.&nbsp;
Thought found rude expression, which gradually among other forms assumed
that of words.&nbsp; These reacted upon thought, and thought again on
them, but thought is no more identical with words than words are with
the separate letters of which they are composed.</p>
<p>To sum up, then, and to conclude.&nbsp; I would ask you to see the
connection between words and ideas as in the first instance arbitrary.&nbsp;
No doubt in some cases an imitation of the cry of some bird or wild
beast would suggest the name that should be attached to it; occasionally
the sound of an operation such as grinding may have influenced the choice
of the letters g, r, as the root of many words that denote a grinding,
grating, grasping, crushing action; but I understand that the number
of words due to direct imitation is comparatively few in number, and
that they have been mainly coined as the result of connections so far-fetched
and fanciful as to amount practically to no connection at all.&nbsp;
Once chosen, however, they were adhered to for a considerable time among
the dwellers in any given place, so as to become acknowledged as the
vulgar tongue, and raise readily in the mind of the inhabitants of that
place the ideas with which they had been artificially associated.</p>
<p>As regards our being able to think and reason without words, the
Duke of Argyll has put the matter as soundly as I have yet seen it stated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;quite certain that we
can and do constantly think of things without thinking of any sound
or word as designating them.&nbsp; Language seems to me to be necessary
for the progress of thought, but not at all for the mere act of thinking.&nbsp;
It is a product of thought, an expression of it, a vehicle for the communication
of it, and an embodiment which is essential to its growth and continuity;
but it seems to me altogether erroneous to regard it as an inseparable
part of cogitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following passages, again, are quoted from Sir William Hamilton
in Professor Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s own book, with so much approval
as to lead one to suppose that the differences between himself and his
opponents are in reality less than he believes them to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Language,&rdquo; says Sir W. Hamilton, &ldquo;is the attribution
of signs to our cognitions of things.&nbsp; But as a cognition must
have already been there before it could receive a sign, consequently
that knowledge which is denoted by the formation and application of
a word must have preceded the symbol that denotes it.&nbsp; A sign,
however, is necessary to give stability to our intellectual progress&mdash;to
establish each step in our advance as a new starting-point for our advance
to another beyond.&nbsp; A country may be overrun by an armed host,
but it is only conquered by the establishment of fortresses.&nbsp; Words
are the fortresses of thought.&nbsp; They enable us to realize our dominion
over what we have already overrun in thought; to make every intellectual
conquest the base of operations for others still beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; says Professor Max M&uuml;ller, &ldquo;is a most
happy illustration,&rdquo; and he proceeds to quote the following, also
from Sir William Hamilton, which he declares to be even happier still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all heard,&rdquo; says Sir William Hamilton, &ldquo;of
the process of tunnelling through a sandbank.&nbsp; In this operation
it is impossible to succeed unless every foot, nay, almost every inch
of our progress be secured by an arch of masonry before we attempted
the excavation of another.&nbsp; Now language is to the mind precisely
what the arch is to the tunnel.&nbsp; The power of thinking and the
power of excavation are not dependent on the words in the one case or
on the mason-work in the other; but without these subsidiaries neither
could be carried on beyond its rudimentary commencement.&nbsp; Though,
therefore, we allow that every movement forward in language must be
determined by an antecedent movement forward in thought, still, unless
thought be accompanied at each point of its evolutions by a corresponding
evolution of language, its further development is arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man has evolved an articulate language, whereas the lower animals
seem to be without one.&nbsp; Man, therefore, has far outstripped them
in reasoning faculty as well as in power of expression.&nbsp; This,
however, does not bar the communications which the lower animals make
to one another from possessing all the essential characteristics of
language, and, as a matter of fact, wherever we can follow them we find
such communications effectuated by the aid of arbitrary symbols covenanted
upon by the living beings that wish to communicate, and persistently
associated with certain corresponding feelings, states of mind, or material
objects.&nbsp; Human language is nothing more than this in principle,
however much further the principle has been carried in our own case
than in that of the lower animals.</p>
<p>This being admitted, we should infer that the thought or reason on
which the language of men and animals is alike founded differs as between
men and brutes in degree but not in kind.&nbsp; More than this cannot
be claimed on behalf of the lower animals, even by their most enthusiastic
admirer.</p>
<h2>The Deadlock in Darwinism: Part I <a name="citation245"></a><a href="#footnote245">{245}</a></h2>
<p>It will be readily admitted that of all living writers Mr. Alfred
Russel Wallace is the one the peculiar turn of whose mind best fits
him to write on the subject of natural selection, or the accumulation
of fortunate but accidental variations through descent and the struggle
for existence.&nbsp; His mind in all its more essential characteristics
closely resembles that of the late Mr. Charles Darwin himself, and it
is no doubt due to this fact that he and Mr. Darwin elaborated their
famous theory at the same time, and independently of one another.&nbsp;
I shall have occasion in the course of the following article to show
how misled and misleading both these distinguished men have been, in
spite of their unquestionable familiarity with the whole range of animal
and vegetable phenomena.&nbsp; I believe it will be more respectful
to both of them to do this in the most outspoken way.&nbsp; I believe
their work to have been as mischievous as it has been valuable, and
as valuable as it has been mischievous; and higher, whether praise or
blame, I know not how to give.&nbsp; Nevertheless I would in the outset,
and with the utmost sincerity, admit concerning Messrs. Wallace and
Darwin that neither can be held as the more profound and conscientious
thinker; neither can be put forward as the more ready to acknowledge
obligation to the great writers on evolution who had preceded him, or
to place his own developments in closer and more conspicuous historical
connection with earlier thought upon the subject; neither is the more
ready to welcome criticism and to state his opponent&rsquo;s case in
the most pointed and telling way in which it can be put; neither is
the more quick to encourage new truth; neither is the more genial, generous
adversary, or has the profounder horror of anything even approaching
literary or scientific want of candour; both display the same inimitable
power of putting their opinions forward in the way that shall best ensure
their acceptance; both are equally unrivalled in the tact that tells
them when silence will be golden, and when on the other hand a whole
volume of facts may be advantageously brought forward.&nbsp; Less than
the foregoing tribute both to Messrs. Darwin and Wallace I will not,
and more I cannot pay.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the most authoritative exponent of latter-day
evolution&mdash;I mean to Mr. Wallace, whose work, entitled <i>Darwinism</i>,
though it should have been entitled <i>Wallaceism</i>, is still so far
Darwinistic that it develops the teaching of Mr. Darwin in the direction
given to it by Mr. Darwin himself&mdash;so far, indeed, as this can
be ascertained at all&mdash;and not in that of Lamarck.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace
tells us, on the first page of his preface, that he has no intention
of dealing even in outline with the vast subject of evolution in general,
and has only tried to give such an account of the theory of natural
selection as may facilitate a clear conception of Darwin&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;
How far he has succeeded is a point on which opinion will probably be
divided.&nbsp; Those who find Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s works clear will also
find no difficulty in understanding Mr. Wallace; those, on the other
hand, who find Mr. Darwin puzzling are little likely to be less puzzled
by Mr. Wallace.&nbsp; He continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The objections now made to Darwin&rsquo;s theory apply solely
to the particular means by which the change of species has been brought
about, not to the fact of that change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But &ldquo;Darwin&rsquo;s theory&rdquo;&mdash;as Mr. Wallace has
elsewhere proved that he understands&mdash;has no reference &ldquo;to
the fact of that change&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, to the fact that
species have been modified in course of descent from other species.&nbsp;
This is no more Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory than it is the reader&rsquo;s
or my own.&nbsp; Darwin&rsquo;s theory is concerned only with &ldquo;the
particular means by which the change of species has been brought about&rdquo;;
his contention being that this is mainly due to the natural survival
of those individuals that have happened by some accident to be born
most favourably adapted to their surroundings, or, in other words, through
accumulation in the common course of nature of the more lucky variations
that chance occasionally purveys.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s words, then,
in reality amount to this, that the objections now made to Darwin&rsquo;s
theory apply solely to Darwin&rsquo;s theory, which is all very well
as far as it goes, but might have been more easily apprehended if he
had simply said, &ldquo;There are several objections now made to Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be remembered that the passage quoted above occurs on the
first page of a preface dated March, 1889, when the writer had completed
his task, and was most fully conversant with his subject.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
it seems indisputable either that he is still confusing evolution with
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory, or that he does not know when his sentences
have point and when they have none.</p>
<p>I should perhaps explain to some readers that Mr. Darwin did not
modify the main theory put forward, first by Buffon, to whom it indisputably
belongs, and adopted from him by Erasmus Darwin, Lamarck, and many other
writers in the latter half of the eighteenth century and the earlier
years of the nineteenth.&nbsp; The early evolutionists maintained that
all existing forms of animal and vegetable life, including man, were
derived in course of descent with modification from forms resembling
the lowest now known.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin went as far as this, and farther no one can go.&nbsp;
The point at issue between him and his predecessors involves neither
the main fact of evolution, nor yet the geometrical ratio of increase,
and the struggle for existence consequent thereon.&nbsp; Messrs. Darwin
and Wallace have each thrown invaluable light upon these last two points,
but Buffon, as early as 1756, had made them the keystone of his system.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The movement of nature,&rdquo; he then wrote, &ldquo;turns on
two immovable pivots: one, the illimitable fecundity which she has given
to all species: the other, the innumerable difficulties which reduce
the results of that fecundity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck
followed in the same sense.&nbsp; They thus admit the survival of the
fittest as fully as Mr. Darwin himself, though they do not make use
of this particular expression.&nbsp; The dispute turns not upon natural
selection, which is common to all writers on evolution, but upon the
nature and causes of the variations that are supposed to be selected
from and thus accumulated.&nbsp; Are these mainly attributable to the
inherited effects of use and disuse, supplemented by occasional sports
and happy accidents?&nbsp; Or are they mainly due to sports and happy
accidents, supplemented by occasional inherited effects of use and disuse?</p>
<p>The Lamarckian system has all along been maintained by Mr. Herbert
Spencer, who, in his <i>Principles of Biology</i>, published in 1865,
showed how impossible it was that accidental variations should accumulate
at all.&nbsp; I am not sure how far Mr. Spencer would consent to being
called a Lamarckian pure and simple, nor yet how far it is strictly
accurate to call him one; nevertheless, I can see no important difference
in the main positions taken by him and by Lamarck.</p>
<p>The question at issue between the Lamarckians, supported by Mr. Spencer
and a growing band of those who have risen in rebellion against the
Charles-Darwinian system on the one hand, and Messrs. Darwin and Wallace
with the greater number of our more prominent biologists on the other,
involves the very existence of evolution as a workable theory.&nbsp;
For it is plain that what Nature can be supposed able to do by way of
choice must depend on the supply of the variations from which she is
supposed to choose.&nbsp; She cannot take what is not offered to her;
and so again she cannot be supposed able to accumulate unless what is
gained in one direction in one generation, or series of generations,
is little likely to be lost in those that presently succeed.&nbsp; Now
variations ascribed mainly to use and disuse can be supposed capable
of being accumulated, for use and disuse are fairly constant for long
periods among the individuals of the same species, and often over large
areas; moreover, conditions of existence involving changes of habit,
and thus of organization, come for the most part gradually; so that
time is given during which the organism can endeavour to adapt itself
in the requisite respects, instead of being shocked out of existence
by too sudden change.&nbsp; Variations, on the other hand, that are
ascribed to mere chance cannot be supposed as likely to be accumulated,
for chance is notoriously inconstant, and would not purvey the variations
in sufficiently unbroken succession, or in a sufficient number of individuals,
modified similarly in all the necessary correlations at the same time
and place to admit of their being accumulated.&nbsp; It is vital therefore
to the theory of evolution, as was early pointed out by the late Professor
Fleeming Jenkin and by Mr. Herbert Spencer, that variations should be
supposed to have a definite and persistent principle underlying them,
which shall tend to engender similar and simultaneous modification,
however small, in the vast majority of individuals composing any species.&nbsp;
The existence of such a principle and its permanence is the only thing
that can be supposed capable of acting as rudder and compass to the
accumulation of variations, and of making it hold steadily on one course
for each species, till eventually many havens, far remote from one another,
are safely reached.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the having fatally impaired the theory of his
predecessors could not warrant Mr. Darwin in claiming, as he most fatuously
did, the theory of evolution.&nbsp; That he is still generally believed
to have been the originator of this theory is due to the fact that he
claimed it, and that a powerful literary backing at once came forward
to support him.&nbsp; It seems at first sight improbable that those
who too zealously urged his claims were unaware that so much had been
written on the subject, but when we find even Mr. Wallace himself as
profoundly ignorant on this subject as he still either is, or affects
to be, there is no limit assignable to the ignorance or affected ignorance
of the kind of biologists who would write reviews in leading journals
thirty years ago.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few great naturalists, struck by the very slight difference
between many of these species, and the numerous links that exist between
the most different forms of animals and plants, and also observing that
a great many species do vary considerably in their forms, colours and
habits, conceived the idea that they might be all produced one from
the other.&nbsp; The most eminent of these writers was a great French
naturalist, Lamarck, who published an elaborate work, the <i>Philosophie
Zoologique</i>, in which he endeavoured to prove that all animals whatever
are descended from other species of animals.&nbsp; He attributed the
change of species chiefly to the effect of changes in the conditions
of life&mdash;such as climate, food, etc.; and especially to the desires
and efforts of the animals themselves to improve their condition, leading
to a modification of form or size in certain parts, owing to the well-known
physiological law that all organs are strengthened by constant use,
while they are weakened or even completely lost by disuse. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only other important work dealing with the question was
the celebrated <i>Vestiges of Creation</i>, published anonymously, but
now acknowledged to have been written by the late Robert Chambers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None are so blind as those who will not see, and it would be waste
of time to argue with the invincible ignorance of one who thinks Lamarck
and Buffon conceived that all species were produced from one another,
more especially as I have already dealt at some length with the early
evolutionists in my work <i>Evolution</i>, <i>Old and New</i>, first
published ten years ago, and not, so far as I am aware, detected in
serious error or omission.&nbsp; If, however, Mr. Wallace still thinks
it safe to presume so far on the ignorance of his readers as to say
that the only two important works on evolution before Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
were Lamarck&rsquo;s <i>Philosophie Zoologique</i> and the <i>Vestiges
of Creation</i>, how fathomable is the ignorance of the average reviewer
likely to have been thirty years ago, when the <i>Origin of Species</i>
was first published?&nbsp; Mr. Darwin claimed evolution as his own theory.&nbsp;
Of course, he would not claim it if he had no right to it.&nbsp; Then
by all means give him the credit of it.&nbsp; This was the most natural
view to take, and it was generally taken.&nbsp; It was not, moreover,
surprising that people failed to appreciate all the niceties of Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;distinctive feature&rdquo; which, whether distinctive
or no, was assuredly not distinct, and was never frankly contrasted
with the older view, as it would have been by one who wished it to be
understood and judged upon its merits.&nbsp; It was in consequence of
this omission that people failed to note how fast and loose Mr. Darwin
played with his distinctive feature, and how readily he dropped it on
occasion.</p>
<p>It may be said that the question of what was thought by the predecessors
of Mr. Darwin is, after all, personal, and of no interest to the general
public, comparable to that of the main issue&mdash;whether we are to
accept evolution or not.&nbsp; Granted that Buff on, Erasmus Darwin,
and Lamarck bore the burden and heat of the day before Mr. Charles Darwin
was born, they did not bring people round to their opinion, whereas
Mr. Darwin and Mr. Wallace did, and the public cannot be expected to
look beyond this broad and indisputable fact.</p>
<p>The answer to this is, that the theory which Messrs. Darwin and Wallace
have persuaded the public to accept is demonstrably false, and that
the opponents of evolution are certain in the end to triumph over it.&nbsp;
Paley, in his <i>Natural Theology</i>, long since brought forward far
too much evidence of design in animal organization to allow of our setting
down its marvels to the accumulation of fortunate accident, undirected
by will, effort and intelligence.&nbsp; Those who examine the main facts
of animal and vegetable organization without bias will, no doubt, ere
long conclude that all animals and vegetables are derived ultimately
from unicellular organisms, but they will not less readily perceive
that the evolution of species without the concomitance and direction
of mind and effort is as inconceivable as is the independent creation
of every individual species.&nbsp; The two facts, evolution and design,
are equally patent to plain people.&nbsp; There is no escaping from
either.&nbsp; According to Messrs. Darwin and Wallace, we may have evolution,
but are on no account to have it as mainly due to intelligent effort,
guided by ever higher and higher range of sensations, perceptions, and
ideas.&nbsp; We are to set it down to the shuffling of cards, or the
throwing of dice without the play, and this will never stand.</p>
<p>According to the older men, cards did indeed count for much, but
play counted for more.&nbsp; They denied the teleology of the time&mdash;that
is to say, the teleology that saw all adaptation to surroundings as
part of a plan devised long ages since by a quasi-anthropomorphic being
who schemed everything out much as a man would do, but on an infinitely
vaster scale.&nbsp; This conception they found repugnant alike to intelligence
and conscience, but, though they do not seem to have perceived it, they
left the door open for a design more true and more demonstrable than
that which they excluded.&nbsp; By making their variations mainly due
to effort and intelligence, they made organic development run on all-fours
with human progress, and with inventions which we have watched growing
up from small beginnings.&nbsp; They made the development of man from
the amoeba part and parcel of the story that may be read, though on
an infinitely smaller scale, in the development of our most powerful
marine engines from the common kettle, or of our finest microscopes
from the dew-drop.</p>
<p>The development of the steam-engine and the microscope is due to
intelligence and design, which did indeed utilize chance suggestions,
but which improved on these, and directed each step of their accumulation,
though never foreseeing more than a step or two ahead, and often not
so much as this.&nbsp; The fact, as I have elsewhere urged, that the
man who made the first kettle did not foresee the engines of the <i>Great
Eastern</i>, or that he who first noted the magnifying power of the
dew-drop had no conception of our present microscopes&mdash;the very
limited amount, in fact, of design and intelligence that was called
into play at any one point&mdash;this does not make us deny that the
steam-engine and microscope owe their development to design.&nbsp; If
each step of the road was designed, the whole journey was designed,
though the particular end was not designed when the journey was begun.&nbsp;
And so is it, according to the older view of evolution, with the development
of those living organs, or machines, that are born with us, as part
of the perambulating carpenter&rsquo;s chest we call our bodies.&nbsp;
The older view gives us our design, and gives us our evolution too.&nbsp;
If it refuses to see a quasi-anthropomorphic God modelling each species
from without as a potter models clay, it gives us God as vivifying and
indwelling in all His creatures&mdash;He in them, and they in Him.&nbsp;
If it refuses to see God outside the universe, it equally refuses to
see any part of the universe as outside God.&nbsp; If it makes the universe
the body of God, it also makes God the soul of the universe.&nbsp; The
question at issue, then, between the Darwinism of Erasmus Darwin and
the neo-Darwinism of his grandson, is not a personal one, nor anything
like a personal one.&nbsp; It not only involves the existence of evolution,
but it affects the view we take of life and things in an endless variety
of most interesting and important ways.&nbsp; It is imperative, therefore,
on those who take any interest in these matters, to place side by side
in the clearest contrast the views of those who refer the evolution
of species mainly to accumulation of variations that have no other inception
than chance, and of that older school which makes design perceive and
develop still further the goods that chance provides.</p>
<p>But over and above this, which would be in itself sufficient, the
historical mode of studying any question is the only one which will
enable us to comprehend it effectually.&nbsp; The personal element cannot
be eliminated from the consideration of works written by living persons
for living persons.&nbsp; We want to know who is who&mdash;whom we can
depend upon to have no other end than the making things clear to himself
and his readers, and whom we should mistrust as having an ulterior aim
on which he is more intent than on the furthering of our better understanding.&nbsp;
We want to know who is doing his best to help us, and who is only trying
to make us help him, or to bolster up the system in which his interests
are vested.&nbsp; There is nothing that will throw more light upon these
points than the way in which a man behaves towards those who have worked
in the same field with himself, and, again, than his style.&nbsp; A
man&rsquo;s style, as Buffon long since said, is the man himself.&nbsp;
By style, I do not, of course, mean grammar or rhetoric, but that style
of which Buffon again said that it is like happiness, and <i>vient de
la douceur de l&rsquo;&acirc;me</i>.&nbsp; When we find a man concealing
worse than nullity of meaning under sentences that sound plausibly enough,
we should distrust him much as we should a fellow-traveller whom we
caught trying to steal our watch.&nbsp; We often cannot judge of the
truth or falsehood of facts for ourselves, but we most of us know enough
of human nature to be able to tell a good witness from a bad one.</p>
<p>However this may be, and whatever we may think of judging systems
by the directness or indirectness of those who advance them, biologists,
having committed themselves too rashly, would have been more than human
if they had not shown some pique towards those who dared to say, first,
that the theory of Messrs. Darwin and Wallace was unworkable; and secondly,
that even though it were workable it would not justify either of them
in claiming evolution.&nbsp; When biologists show pique at all they
generally show a good deal of pique, but pique or no pique, they shunned
Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s objection above referred to with a persistency more
unanimous and obstinate than I ever remember to have seen displayed
even by professional truth-seekers.&nbsp; I find no rejoinder to it
from Mr. Darwin himself, between 1865 when it was first put forward,
and 1882 when Mr. Darwin died.&nbsp; It has been similarly &ldquo;ostrichized&rdquo;
by all the leading apologists of Darwinism, so far at least as I have
been able to observe, and I have followed the matter closely for many
years.&nbsp; Mr. Spencer has repeated and amplified it in his recent
work <i>The Factors of Organic Evolution</i>, but it still remains without
so much as an attempt at serious answer, for the perfunctory and illusory
remarks of Mr. Wallace at the end of his <i>Darwinism</i> cannot be
counted as such.&nbsp; The best proof of its irresistible weight is
that Mr. Darwin, though maintaining silence in respect to it, retreated
from his original position in the direction that would most obviate
Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s objection.</p>
<p>Yet this objection has been repeatedly urged by the more prominent
anti-Charles-Darwinian authorities, and there is no sign that the British
public is becoming less rigorous in requiring people either to reply
to objections repeatedly urged by men of even moderate weight, or to
let judgment go by default.&nbsp; As regards Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s claim
to the theory of evolution generally, Darwinians are beginning now to
perceive that this cannot be admitted, and either say with some hardihood
that Mr. Darwin never claimed it, or after a few saving clauses to the
effect that this theory refers only to the particular means by which
evolution has been brought about, imply forthwith thereafter none the
less that evolution is Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace
has done this repeatedly in his recent <i>Darwinism</i>.&nbsp; Indeed,
I should be by no means sure that on the first page of his preface,
in the passage about &ldquo;Darwin&rsquo;s theory,&rdquo; which I have
already somewhat severely criticized, he was not intending evolution
by &ldquo;Darwin&rsquo;s theory,&rdquo; if in his preceding paragraph
he had not so clearly shown that he knew evolution to be a theory of
greatly older date than Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The history of science&mdash;well exemplified by that of the development
theory&mdash;is the history of eminent men who have fought against light
and have been worsted.&nbsp; The tenacity with which Darwinians stick
to their accumulation of fortuitous variations is on a par with the
like tenacity shown by the illustrious Cuvier, who did his best to crush
evolution altogether.&nbsp; It always has been thus, and always will
be; nor is it desirable in the interests of Truth herself that it should
be otherwise.&nbsp; Truth is like money&mdash;lightly come, lightly
go; and if she cannot hold her own against even gross misrepresentation,
she is herself not worth holding.&nbsp; Misrepresentation in the long
run makes Truth as much as it mars her; hence our law courts do not
think it desirable that pleaders should speak their <i>bona fide</i>
opinions, much less that they should profess to do so.&nbsp; Rather
let each side hoodwink judge and jury as best it can, and let truth
flash out from collision of defence and accusation.&nbsp; When either
side will not collide, it is an axiom of controversy that it desires
to prevent the truth from being elicited.</p>
<p>Let us now note the courses forced upon biologists by the difficulties
of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s distinctive feature.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin and Mr.
Wallace, as is well known, brought the feature forward simultaneously
and independently of one another, but Mr. Wallace always believed in
it more firmly than Mr. Darwin did.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin as a young man
did not believe in it.&nbsp; He wrote before 1839, &ldquo;Nature, by
making habit omnipotent and its effects hereditary, has fitted the Fuegian
for the climate and productions of his country,&rdquo; <a name="citation259a"></a><a href="#footnote259a">{259a}</a>
a sentence than which nothing can coincide more fully with the older
view that use and disuse were the main purveyors of variations, or conflict
more fatally with his own subsequent distinctive feature.&nbsp; Moreover,
as I showed in my last work on evolution, <a name="citation259b"></a><a href="#footnote259b">{259b}</a>
in the peroration to his <i>Origin of Species</i>, he discarded his
accidental variations altogether, and fell back on the older theory,
so that the body of the <i>Origin of Species</i> supports one theory,
and the peroration another that differs from it <i>toto c&oelig;lo</i>.&nbsp;
Finally, in his later editions, he retreated indefinitely from his original
position, edging always more and more continually towards the theory
of his grandfather and Lamarck.&nbsp; These facts convince me that he
was at no time a thoroughgoing Darwinian, but was throughout an unconscious
Lamarckian, though ever anxious to conceal the fact alike from himself
and from his readers.</p>
<p>Not so with Mr. Wallace, who was both more outspoken in the first
instance, and who has persevered along the path of Wallaceism just as
Mr. Darwin with greater sagacity was ever on the retreat from Darwinism.&nbsp;
Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s profounder faith led him in the outset to place
his theory in fuller daylight than Mr. Darwin was inclined to do.&nbsp;
Mr. Darwin just waved Lamarck aside, and said as little about him as
he could, while in his earlier editions Erasmus Darwin and Buffon were
not so much as named.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace, on the contrary, at once raised
the Lamarckian spectre, and declared it exorcized.&nbsp; He said the
Lamarckian hypothesis was &ldquo;quite unnecessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
giraffe did not &ldquo;acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the
foliage of the more lofty shrubs, and constantly stretching its neck
for this purpose, but because any varieties which occurred among its
antitypes with a longer neck than usual at once secured a fresh range
of pasture over the same ground as their shorter-necked companions,
and on the first scarcity of food were thus enabled to outlive them.&rdquo;
<a name="citation260"></a><a href="#footnote260">{260}</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Which occurred&rdquo; is evidently &ldquo;which happened to
occur&rdquo; by some chance of accident unconnected with use and disuse.&nbsp;
The word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; is never used, but Mr. Wallace must
be credited with this instance of a desire to give his readers a chance
of perceiving that according to his distinctive feature evolution is
an affair of luck, rather than of cunning.&nbsp; Whether his readers
actually did understand this as clearly as Mr. Wallace doubtless desired
that they should, and whether greater development at this point would
not have helped them to fuller apprehension, we need not now inquire.&nbsp;
What was gained in distinctness might have been lost in distinctiveness,
and after all he did technically put us upon our guard.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he too at a pinch takes refuge in Lamarckism.&nbsp;
In relation to the manner in which the eyes of soles, turbots, and other
flat-fish travel round the head so as to become in the end unsymmetrically
placed, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eyes of these fish are curiously distorted in order that
both eyes may be upon the upper side, where alone they would be of any
use. . . .&nbsp; Now if we suppose this process, which in the young
is completed in a few days or weeks, to have been spread over thousands
of generations during the development of these fish, those usually surviving
<i>whose eyes retained more and more of the position into which the
young fish tried to twist them</i> [italics mine], the change becomes
intelligible.&rdquo; <a name="citation261"></a><a href="#footnote261">{261}</a>&nbsp;
When it was said by Professor Ray Lankester&mdash;who knows as well
as most people what Lamarck taught&mdash;that this was &ldquo;flat Lamarckism,&rdquo;
Mr. Wallace rejoined that it was the survival of the modified individuals
that did it all, not the efforts of the young fish to twist their eyes,
and the transmission to descendants of the effects of those efforts.&nbsp;
But this, as I said in my book <i>Evolution</i>, <i>Old and New</i>,
is like saying that horses are swift runners, not by reason of the causes,
whatever they were, that occasioned the direct line of their progenitors
to vary towards ever greater and greater swiftness, but because their
more slow-going uncles and aunts go away.&nbsp; Plain people will prefer
to say that the main cause of any accumulation of favourable modifications
consists rather in that which brings about the initial variations, and
in the fact that these can be inherited at all, than in the fact that
the unmodified individuals were not successful.&nbsp; People do not
become rich because the poor in large numbers go away, but because they
have been lucky, or provident, or more commonly both.&nbsp; If they
would keep their wealth when they have made it they must exclude luck
thenceforth to the utmost of their power and their children must follow
their example, or they will soon lose their money.&nbsp; The fact that
the weaker go to the wall does not bring about the greater strength
of the stronger; it is the consequence of this last and not the cause&mdash;unless,
indeed, it be contended that a knowledge that the weak go to the wall
stimulates the strong to exertions which they would not otherwise so
make, and that these exertions produce inheritable modifications.&nbsp;
Even in this case, however, it would be the exertions, or use and disuse,
that would be the main agents in the modification.&nbsp; But it is not
often that Mr. Wallace thus backslides.&nbsp; His present position is
that acquired (as distinguished from congenital) modifications are not
inherited at all.&nbsp; He does not indeed put his faith prominently
forward and pin himself to it as plainly as could be wished, but under
the heading &ldquo;The Non-Heredity of Acquired Characters,&rdquo; he
writes as follows on p. 440 of his recent work in reference to Professor
Weismann&rsquo;s Theory of Heredity:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain observations on the embryology of the lower animals
are held to afford direct proof of this theory of heredity, but they
are too technical to be made clear to ordinary readers.&nbsp; A logical
result of the theory is the impossibility of the transmission of acquired
characters, since the molecular structure of the germ-plasm is already
determined within the embryo; and Weismann holds that there are no facts
which really prove that acquired characters can be inherited, although
their inheritance has, by most writers, been considered so probable
as hardly to stand in need of direct proof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have already seen in the earlier part of this chapter that
many instances of change, imputed to the inheritance of acquired variations,
are really cases of selection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the rest of the remarks tend to convey the impression that Mr.
Wallace adopts Professor Weismann&rsquo;s view, but, curiously enough,
though I have gone through Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s book with a special view
to this particular point, I have not been able to find him definitely
committing himself either to the assertion that acquired modifications
never are inherited, or that they sometimes are so.&nbsp; It is abundantly
laid down that Mr. Darwin laid too much stress on use and disuse, and
a residuary impression is left that Mr. Wallace is endorsing Professor
Weismann&rsquo;s view, but I have found it impossible to collect anything
that enables me to define his position confidently in this respect.</p>
<p>This is natural enough, for Mr. Wallace has entitled his book <i>Darwinism</i>,
and a work denying that use and disuse produced any effect could not
conceivably be called Darwinism.&nbsp; Mr. Herbert Spencer has recently
collected many passages from <i>The Origin of Species</i> and from <i>Animals
and Plants under Domestication</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation263"></a><a href="#footnote263">{263}</a>
which show how largely, after all, use and disuse entered into Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
system, and we know that in his later years he attached still more importance
to them.&nbsp; It was out of the question, therefore, that Mr. Wallace
should categorically deny that their effects were inheritable.&nbsp;
On the other hand, the temptation to adopt Professor Weismann&rsquo;s
view must have been overwhelming to one who had been already inclined
to minimize the effects of use and disuse.&nbsp; On the whole, one does
not see what Mr. Wallace could do, other than what he has done&mdash;unless,
of course, he changed his title, or had been no longer Mr. Wallace.</p>
<p>Besides, thanks to the works of Mr. Spencer, Professor Mivart, Professor
Semper, and very many others, there has for some time been a growing
perception that the Darwinism of Charles Darwin was doomed.&nbsp; Use
and disuse must either do even more than is officially recognized in
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s later concessions, or they must do a great deal less.&nbsp;
If they can do as much as Mr. Darwin himself said they did, why should
they not do more?&nbsp; Why stop where Mr. Darwin did?&nbsp; And again,
where in the name of all that is reasonable did he really stop?&nbsp;
He drew no line, and on what principle can we say that so much is possible
as effect of use and disuse, but so much more impossible?&nbsp; If,
as Mr. Darwin contended, disuse can so far reduce an organ as to render
it rudimentary, and in many cases get rid of it altogether, why cannot
use create as much as disuse can destroy, provided it has anything,
no matter how low in structure, to begin with?&nbsp; Let us know where
we stand.&nbsp; If it is admitted that use and disuse can do a good
deal, what does a good deal mean?&nbsp; And what is the proportion between
the shares attributable to use and disuse and to natural selection respectively?&nbsp;
If we cannot be told with absolute precision, let us at any rate have
something more definite than the statement that natural selection is
&ldquo;the most important means of modification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin gave us no help in this respect; and worse than this,
he contradicted himself so flatly as to show that he had very little
definite idea upon the subject at all.&nbsp; Thus in respect to the
winglessness of the Madeira beetles he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications
of structure, which are wholly or mainly due to natural selection.&nbsp;
Mr. Wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out
of the 550 species (but more are now known) inhabiting Madeira, are
so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that of the 29 endemic
genera no less than 23 have all their species in this condition!&nbsp;
Several facts&mdash;namely, that beetles in many parts of the world
are frequently blown out to sea and perish; that the beetles in Madeira,
as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much concealed until the wind lulls
and the sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger
on the exposed Desertas than in Madeira itself; and especially the extraordinary
fact, so strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston, that certain large groups
of beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, which absolutely require
the use of their wings are here almost entirely absent;&mdash;these
several considerations make me believe that the wingless condition of
so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of natural selection,
<i>combined probably with disuse</i> [italics mine].&nbsp; For during
many successive generations each individual beetle which flew least,
either from its wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed
or from indolent habit, will have had the best chance of surviving,
from not being blown out to sea; and, on the other hand, those beetles
which most readily took to flight would oftenest have been blown to
sea, and thus destroyed.&rdquo; <a name="citation265"></a><a href="#footnote265">{265}</a></p>
<p>We should like to know, first, somewhere about how much disuse was
able to do after all, and moreover why, if it can do anything at all,
it should not be able to do all.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin says: &ldquo;Any change
in structure and function which can be effected by small stages is within
the power of natural selection.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And why not,&rdquo;
we ask, &ldquo;within the power of use and disuse?&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover,
on a later page we find Mr. Darwin saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It appears probable that disuse has been the main agent
in rendering organs rudimentary</i> [italics mine].&nbsp; It would at
first lead by slow steps to the more and more complete reduction of
a part, until at last it has become rudimentary&mdash;as in the case
of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark caverns, and of the wings of
birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which have seldom been forced by beasts
of prey to take flight, and have ultimately lost the power of flying.&nbsp;
Again, an organ, useful under certain conditions, might become injurious
under others, as <i>with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed
islands</i>; and in this case natural selection will have aided in reducing
the organ, until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary [italics mine].&rdquo;
<a name="citation266"></a><a href="#footnote266">{266}</a></p>
<p>So that just as an undefined amount of use and disuse was introduced
on the earlier page to supplement the effects of natural selection in
respect of the wings of beetles on small and exposed islands, we have
here an undefined amount of natural selection introduced to supplement
the effects of use and disuse in respect of the identical phenomena.&nbsp;
In the one passage we find that natural selection has been the main
agent in reducing the wings, though use and disuse have had an appreciable
share in the result; in the other, it is use and disuse that have been
the main agents, though an appreciable share in the result must be ascribed
to natural selection.</p>
<p>Besides, who has seen the uncles and aunts going away with the uniformity
that is necessary for Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s contention?&nbsp; We know that
birds and insects do often get blown out to sea and perish, but in order
to establish Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s position we want the evidence of those
who watched the reduction of the wings during the many generations in
the course of which it was being effected, and who can testify that
all, or the overwhelming majority, of the beetles born with fairly well-developed
wings got blown out to sea, while those alone survived whose wings were
congenitally degenerate.&nbsp; Who saw them go, or can point to analogous
cases so conclusive as to compel assent from any equitable thinker?</p>
<p>Darwinians of the stamp of Mr. Thiselton Dyer, Professor Ray Lankester,
or Mr. Romanes, insist on their pound of flesh in the matter of irrefragable
demonstration.&nbsp; They complain of us for not bringing forward someone
who has been able to detect the movement of the hour-hand of a watch
during a second of time, and when we fail to do so, declare triumphantly
that we have no evidence that there is any connection between the beating
of a second and the movement of the hour-hand.&nbsp; When we say that
rain comes from the condensation of moisture in the atmosphere, they
demand of us a rain-drop from moisture not yet condensed.&nbsp; If they
stickle for proof and cavil on the ninth part of a hair, as they do
when we bring forward what we deem excellent instances of the transmission
of an acquired characteristic, why may not we, too, demand at any rate
some evidence that the unmodified beetles actually did always, or nearly
always, get blown out to sea, during the reduction above referred to,
and that it is to this fact, and not to the masterly inactivity of their
fathers and mothers, that the Madeira beetles owe their winglessness?&nbsp;
If we begin stickling for proof in this way, our opponents would not
be long in letting us know that absolute proof is unattainable on any
subject, that reasonable presumption is our highest certainty, and that
crying out for too much evidence is as bad as accepting too little.&nbsp;
Truth is like a photographic sensitized plate, which is equally ruined
by over and by under exposure, and the just exposure for which can never
be absolutely determined.</p>
<p>Surely if disuse can be credited with the vast powers involved in
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s statement that it has probably &ldquo;been the main
agent in rendering organs rudimentary,&rdquo; no limits are assignable
to the accumulated effects of habit, provided the effects of habit,
or use and disuse, are supposed, as Mr. Darwin supposed them, to be
inheritable at all.&nbsp; Darwinians have at length woke up to the dilemma
in which they are placed by the manner in which Mr. Darwin tried to
sit on the two stools of use and disuse, and natural selection of accidental
variations, at the same time.&nbsp; The knell of Charles-Darwinism is
rung in Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s present book, and in the general perception
on the part of biologists that we must either assign to use and disuse
such a predominant share in modification as to make it the feature most
proper to be insisted on, or deny that the modifications, whether of
mind or body, acquired during a single lifetime, are ever transmitted
at all.&nbsp; If they can be inherited at all, they can be accumulated.&nbsp;
If they can be accumulated at all, they can be so, for anything that
appears to the contrary, to the extent of the specific and generic differences
with which we are surrounded.&nbsp; The only thing to do is to pluck
them out root and branch: they are as a cancer which, if the smallest
fibre be left unexcised, will grow again, and kill any system on to
which it is allowed to fasten.&nbsp; Mr. Wallace, therefore, may well
be excused if he casts longing eyes towards Weismannism.</p>
<p>And what was Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s system?&nbsp; Who can make head or
tail of the inextricable muddle in which he left it?&nbsp; The <i>Origin
of Species</i> in its latest shape is the reduction of hedging to an
absurdity.&nbsp; How did Mr. Darwin himself leave it in the last chapter
of the last edition of the <i>Origin of Species</i>?&nbsp; He wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have now recapitulated the facts and considerations which
have thoroughly convinced me that species have been modified during
a long course of descent.&nbsp; This has been effected chiefly through
the natural selection of numerous, successive, slight, favourable variations;
aided in an important manner by the inherited effects of the use and
disuse of parts, and in an unimportant manner&mdash;that is, in relation
to adaptive structures whether past or present&mdash;by the direct action
of external conditions, and by variations which seem to us in our ignorance
to arise spontaneously.&nbsp; It appears that I formerly underrated
the frequency and value of these latter forms of variation, as leading
to permanent modifications of structure independently of natural selection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;numerous, successive, slight, favourable variations&rdquo;
above referred to are intended to be fortuitous, accidental, spontaneous.&nbsp;
It is the essence of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory that this should be so.&nbsp;
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s solemn statement, therefore, of his theory, after
he had done his best or his worst with it, is, when stripped of surplusage,
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The modification of species has been mainly effected by accumulation
of spontaneous variations; it has been aided in an important manner
by accumulation of variations due to use and disuse, and in an unimportant
manner by spontaneous variations; I do not even now think that spontaneous
variations have been very important, but I used once to think them less
important than I do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a discouraging symptom of the age that such a system should
have been so long belauded, and it is a sign of returning intelligence
that even he who has been more especially the <i>alter ego</i> of Mr.
Darwin should have felt constrained to close the chapter of Charles-Darwinism
as a living theory, and relegate it to the important but not very creditable
place in history which it must henceforth occupy.&nbsp; It is astonishing,
however, that Mr. Wallace should have quoted the extract from the <i>Origin
of Species</i> just given, as he has done on p. 412 of his <i>Darwinism</i>,
without betraying any sign that he has caught its driftlessness&mdash;for
drift, other than a desire to hedge, it assuredly has not got.&nbsp;
The battle now turns on the question whether modifications of either
structure or instinct due to use or disuse are ever inherited, or whether
they are not.&nbsp; Can the effects of habit be transmitted to progeny
at all?&nbsp; We know that more usually they are not transmitted to
any perceptible extent, but we believe also that occasionally, and indeed
not infrequently, they are inherited and even intensified.&nbsp; What
are our grounds for this opinion?&nbsp; It will be my object to put
these forward in the following number of the <i>Universal Review.</i></p>
<h2>The Deadlock in Darwinism: Part II <a name="citation271"></a><a href="#footnote271">{271}</a></h2>
<p>At the close of my article in last month&rsquo;s number of the <i>Universal
Review</i>, I said I would in this month&rsquo;s issue show why the
opponents of Charles-Darwinism believe the effects of habits acquired
during the lifetime of a parent to produce an effect on their subsequent
offspring, in spite of the fact that we can rarely find the effect in
any one generation, or even in several, sufficiently marked to arrest
our attention.</p>
<p>I will now show that offspring can be, and not very infrequently
is, affected by occurrences that have produced a deep impression on
the parent organism&mdash;the effect produced on the offspring being
such as leaves no doubt that it is to be connected with the impression
produced on the parent.&nbsp; Having thus established the general proposition,
I will proceed to the more particular one&mdash;that habits, involving
use and disuse of special organs, with the modifications of structure
thereby engendered, produce also an effect upon offspring, which, though
seldom perceptible as regards structure in a single, or even in several
generations, is nevertheless capable of being accumulated in successive
generations till it amounts to specific and generic difference.&nbsp;
I have found the first point as much as I can treat within the limits
of this present article, and will avail myself of the hospitality of
the <i>Universal Review</i> next month to deal with the second.</p>
<p>The proposition which I have to defend is one which no one till recently
would have questioned, and even now those who look most askance at it
do not venture to dispute it unreservedly; they every now and then admit
it as conceivable, and even in some cases probable; nevertheless they
seek to minimize it, and to make out that there is little or no connection
between the great mass of the cells of which the body is composed, and
those cells that are alone capable of reproducing the entire organism.&nbsp;
The tendency is to assign to these last a life of their own, apart from,
and unconnected with that of the other cells of the body, and to cheapen
all evidence that tends to prove any response on their part to the past
history of the individual, and hence ultimately of the race.</p>
<p>Professor Weismann is the foremost exponent of those who take this
line.&nbsp; He has naturally been welcomed by English Charles-Darwinians;
for if his view can be sustained, then it can be contended that use
and disuse produce no transmissible effect, and the ground is cut from
under Lamarck&rsquo;s feet; if, on the other hand, his view is unfounded,
the Lamarckian reaction, already strong, will gain still further strength.&nbsp;
The issue, therefore, is important, and is being fiercely contested
by those who have invested their all of reputation for discernment in
Charles-Darwinian securities.</p>
<p>Professor Weismann&rsquo;s theory is, that at every new birth a part
of the substance which proceeds from parents and which goes to form
the new embryo is not used up in forming the new animal, but remains
apart to generate the germ-cells&mdash;or perhaps I should say &ldquo;germ-plasm&rdquo;&mdash;which
the new animal itself will in due course issue.</p>
<p>Contrasting the generally received view with his own, Professor Weismann
says that according to the first of these &ldquo;the organism produces
germ-cells afresh again and again, and that it produces them entirely
from its own substance.&rdquo;&nbsp; While by the second &ldquo;the
germ-cells are no longer looked upon as the product of the parent&rsquo;s
body, at least as far as their essential part&mdash;the specific germ-plasm&mdash;is
concerned; they are rather considered as something which is to be placed
in contrast with the <i>tout ensemble</i> of the cells which make up
the parent&rsquo;s body, and the germ-cells of succeeding generations
stand in a similar relation to one another as a series of generations
of unicellular organisms arising by a continued process of cell-division.&rdquo;
<a name="citation274a"></a><a href="#footnote274a">{274a}</a>&nbsp;
On another page he writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that heredity depends upon the fact that a small
portion of the effective substance of the germ, the germ-plasm, remains
unchanged during the development of the ovum into an organism, and that
this part of the germ-plasm serves as a foundation from which the germ-cells
of the new organism are produced.&nbsp; There is, therefore, continuity
of the germ-plasm from one generation to another.&nbsp; One might represent
the germ-plasm by the metaphor of a long creeping root-stock from which
plants arise at intervals, these latter representing the individuals
of successive generations.&rdquo; <a name="citation274b"></a><a href="#footnote274b">{274b}</a></p>
<p>Mr. Wallace, who does not appear to have read Professor Weismann&rsquo;s
essays themselves, but whose remarks are, no doubt, ultimately derived
from the sequel to the passage just quoted from page 266 of Professor
Weismann&rsquo;s book, contends that the impossibility of the transmission
of acquired characters follows as a logical result from Professor Weismann&rsquo;s
theory, inasmuch as the molecular structure of the germ-plasm that will
go to form any succeeding generation is already predetermined within
the still unformed embryo of its predecessor; &ldquo;and Weismann,&rdquo;
continues Mr. Wallace, &ldquo;holds that there are no facts which really
prove that acquired characters can be inherited, although their inheritance
has, by most writers, been considered so probable as hardly to stand
in need of direct proof.&rdquo; <a name="citation275"></a><a href="#footnote275">{275}</a></p>
<p>Professor Weismann, in passages too numerous to quote, shows that
he recognizes this necessity, and acknowledges that the non-transmission
of acquired characters &ldquo;forms the foundation of the views&rdquo;
set forth in his book, p. 291.</p>
<p>Professor Ray Lankester does not commit himself absolutely to this
view, but lends it support by saying (<i>Nature</i>, December 12, 1889):
&ldquo;It is hardly necessary to say that it has never yet been shown
experimentally that <i>anything</i> acquired by one generation is transmitted
to the next (putting aside diseases).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Romanes, writing in <i>Nature</i>, March 13, 1890, and opposing
certain details of Professor Weismann&rsquo;s theory, so far supports
it as to say that &ldquo;there is the gravest possible doubt lying against
the supposition that any really inherited decrease is due to the inherited
effects of disuse.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;gravest possible doubt&rdquo;
should mean that Mr. Romanes regards it as a moral certainty that disuse
has no transmitted effect in reducing an organ, and it should follow
that he holds use to have no transmitted effect in its development.&nbsp;
The sequel, however, makes me uncertain how far Mr. Romanes intends
this, and I would refer the reader to the article which Mr. Romanes
has just published on Weismann in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> for
this current month.</p>
<p>The burden of Mr. Thiselton Dyer&rsquo;s controversy with the Duke
of Argyll (see <i>Nature</i>, January 16, 1890, <i>et seq</i>.) was
that there was no evidence in support of the transmission of any acquired
modification.&nbsp; The orthodoxy of science, therefore, must be held
as giving at any rate a provisional support to Professor Weismann, but
all of them, including even Professor Weismann himself, shrink from
committing themselves to the opinion that the germ-cells of any organisms
remain in all cases unaffected by the events that occur to the other
cells of the same organism, and until they do this they have knocked
the bottom out of their case.</p>
<p>From among the passages in which Professor Weismann himself shows
a desire to hedge I may take the following from page 170 of his book:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am also far from asserting that the germ-plasm which, as
I hold, is transmitted as the basis of heredity from one generation
to another, is absolutely unchangeable or totally uninfluenced by forces
residing in the organism within which it is transformed into germ-cells.&nbsp;
I am also compelled to admit it as conceivable that organisms may exert
a modifying influence upon their germ-cells, and even that such a process
is to a certain extent inevitable.&nbsp; The nutrition and growth of
the individual must exercise some influence upon its germ-cells . .
. &rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Weismann does indeed go on to say that this influence must
be extremely slight, but we do not care how slight the changes produced
may be, provided they exist and can be transmitted.&nbsp; On an earlier
page (p. 101) he said in regard to variations generally that we should
not expect to find them conspicuous; their frequency would be enough,
if they could be accumulated.&nbsp; The same applies here, if stirring
events that occur to the somatic cells can produce any effect at all
on offspring.&nbsp; A very small effect, provided it can be repeated
and accumulated in successive generations, is all that even the most
exacting Lamarckian will ask for.</p>
<p>Having now made the reader acquainted with the position taken by
the leading Charles-Darwinian authorities, I will return to Professor
Weismann himself, who declares that the transmission of acquired characters
&ldquo;at first sight certainly seems necessary,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it
appears rash to attempt to dispense with its aid.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many phenomena only appear to be intelligible if we assume
the hereditary transmission of such acquired characters as the changes
which we ascribe to the use or disuse of particular organs, or to the
direct influence of climate.&nbsp; Furthermore, how can we explain instinct
as hereditary habit, unless it has gradually arisen by the accumulation,
through heredity, of habits which were practised in succeeding generations?&rdquo;
<a name="citation277"></a><a href="#footnote277">{277}</a></p>
<p>I may say in passing that Professor Weismann appears to suppose that
the view of instinct just given is part of the Charles-Darwinian system,
for on page 389 of his book he says &ldquo;that many observers had followed
Darwin in explaining them [instincts] as inherited habits.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was not Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s own view of the matter.&nbsp; He wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we suppose any habitual action to become inherited&mdash;and
I think it can be shown that this does sometimes happen&mdash;then the
resemblance between what originally was a habit and an instinct becomes
so close as not to be distinguished. . . .&nbsp; But it would be the
most serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts have
been acquired by habit in one generation, and then transmitted by inheritance
to succeeding generations.&nbsp; It can be clearly shown that the most
wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted, namely, those of the
hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have been thus acquired.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>Origin
of Species</i>, ed. 1859, p. 209.]</p>
<p>Again we read: &ldquo;Domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of
as actions which have become inherited solely from long-continued and
compulsory habit, but this, I think, is not true.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.,
p. 214.</p>
<p>Again: &ldquo;I am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative
case of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of inherited
habit, as advanced by Lamarck.&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>Origin of Species</i>,
ed. 1872, p. 233.]</p>
<p>I am not aware that Lamarck advanced the doctrine that instinct is
inherited habit, but he may have done so in some work that I have not
seen.</p>
<p>It is true, as I have more than once pointed out, that in the later
editions of the <i>Origin of Species</i> it is no longer &ldquo;the
<i>most</i> serious&rdquo; error to refer instincts generally to inherited
habit, but it still remains &ldquo;a serious error,&rdquo; and this
slight relaxation of severity does not warrant Professor Weismann in
ascribing to Mr. Darwin an opinion which he emphatically condemned.&nbsp;
His tone, however, is so off-hand, that those who have little acquaintance
with the literature of evolution would hardly guess that he is not much
better informed on this subject than themselves.</p>
<p>Returning to the inheritance of acquired characters, Professor Weismann
says that this has never been proved either by means of direct observation
or by experiment.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must be admitted,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;that there are in existence numerous descriptions of cases which
tend to prove that such mutilations as the loss of fingers, the scars
of wounds, etc., are inherited by the offspring, but in these descriptions
the previous history is invariably obscure, and hence the evidence loses
all scientific value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The experiments of M. Brown-S&eacute;quard throw so much light upon
the question at issue that I will quote at some length from the summary
given by Mr. Darwin in his <i>Variation of Animals and Plants under
Domestication</i>. <a name="citation279"></a><a href="#footnote279">{279}</a>&nbsp;
Mr. Darwin writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With respect to the inheritance of structures mutilated by
injuries or altered by disease, it was until lately difficult to come
to any definite conclusion.&rdquo;&nbsp; [Then follow several cases
in which mutilations practised for many generations are not found to
be transmitted.]&nbsp; &ldquo;Notwithstanding,&rdquo; continues Mr.
Darwin, &ldquo;the above several negative cases, we now possess conclusive
evidence that the effects of operations are sometimes inherited.&nbsp;
Dr. Brown-S&eacute;quard gives the following summary of his observations
on guinea-pigs, and this summary is so important that I will quote the
whole:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;1st.&nbsp; Appearance of epilepsy in animals born of
parents having been rendered epileptic by an injury to the spinal cord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;2nd.&nbsp; Appearance of epilepsy also in animals born
of parents having been rendered epileptic by the section of the sciatic
nerve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;3rd.&nbsp; A change in the shape of the ear in animals
born of parents in which such a change was the effect of a division
of the cervical sympathetic nerve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;4th.&nbsp; Partial closure of the eyelids in animals
born of parents in which that state of the eyelids had been caused either
by the section of the cervical sympathetic nerve or the removal of the
superior cervical ganglion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;5th.&nbsp; Exophthalmia in animals born of parents
in which an injury to the restiform body had produced that protrusion
of the eyeball.&nbsp; This interesting fact I have witnessed a good
many times, and I have seen the transmission of the morbid state of
the eye continue through four generations.&nbsp; In these animals modified
by heredity, the two eyes generally protruded, although in the parents
usually only one showed exophthalmia, the lesion having been made in
most cases only on one of the corpora restiformia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;6th.&nbsp; H&aelig;matoma and dry gangrene of the ears
in animals born of parents in which these ear-alterations had been caused
by an injury to the restiform body near the nib of the calamus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;7th.&nbsp; Absence of two toes out of the three of
the hind leg, and sometimes of the three, in animals whose parents had
eaten up their hind-leg toes which had become anaesthetic from a section
of the sciatic nerve alone, or of that nerve and also of the crural.&nbsp;
Sometimes, instead of complete absence of the toes, only a part of one
or two or three was missing in the young, although in the parent not
only the toes but the whole foot was absent (partly eaten off, partly
destroyed by inflammation, ulceration, or gangrene).</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;8th.&nbsp; Appearance of various morbid states of the
skin and hair of the neck and face in animals born of parents having
had similar alterations in the same parts, as effects of an injury to
the sciatic nerve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be especially observed that Brown-S&eacute;quard
had bred during thirty years many thousand guinea-pigs from animals
which had not been operated upon, and not one of these manifested the
epileptic tendency.&nbsp; Nor has he ever seen a guinea-pig born without
toes, which was not the offspring of parents which had gnawed off their
own toes owing to the sciatic nerve having been divided.&nbsp; Of this
latter fact thirteen instances were carefully recorded, and a greater
number were seen; yet Brown-S&eacute;quard speaks of such cases as one
of the rarer forms of inheritance.&nbsp; It is a still more interesting
fact, &lsquo;that the sciatic nerve in the congenitally toeless animal
has inherited the power of passing through all the different morbid
states which have occurred in one of its parents from the time of the
division till after its reunion with the peripheric end.&nbsp; It is
not, therefore, simply the power of performing an action which is inherited,
but the power of performing a whole series of actions, in a certain
order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In most of the cases of inheritance recorded by Brown-S&eacute;quard
only one of the two parents had been operated upon and was affected.&nbsp;
He concludes by expressing his belief that &lsquo;what is transmitted
is the morbid state of the nervous system,&rsquo; due to the operation
performed on the parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin proceeds to give other instances of inherited effects
of mutilations:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the horse there seems hardly a doubt that exostoses on
the legs, caused by too much travelling on hard roads, are inherited.&nbsp;
Blumenbach records the case of a man who had his little finger on the
right hand almost cut off, and which in consequence grew crooked, and
his sons had the same finger on the same hand similarly crooked.&nbsp;
A soldier, fifteen years before his marriage, lost his left eye from
purulent ophthalmia, and his two sons were microphthalmic on the same
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The late Professor Rolleston, whose competence as an observer no
one is likely to dispute, gave Mr. Darwin two cases as having fallen
under his own notice, one of a man whose knee had been severely wounded,
and whose child was born with the same spot marked or scarred, and the
other of one who was severely cut upon the cheek, and whose child was
born scarred in the same place.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s conclusion
was that &ldquo;the effects of injuries, especially when followed by
disease, or perhaps exclusively when thus followed, are occasionally
inherited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us now see what Professor Weismann has to say against this.&nbsp;
He writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only cases worthy of discussion are the well-known experiments
upon guinea-pigs conducted by the French physiologist, Brown-S&eacute;quard.&nbsp;
But the explanation of his results is, in my opinion, open to discussion.&nbsp;
In these cases we have to do with the apparent transmission of artificially
produced malformations. . . .&nbsp; All these effects were said to be
transmitted to descendants as far as the fifth or sixth generation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must inquire whether these cases are really due to
heredity, and not to simple infection.&nbsp; In the case of epilepsy,
at any rate, it is easy to imagine that the passage of some specific
organism through the reproductive cells may take place, as in the case
of syphilis.&nbsp; We are, however, entirely ignorant of the nature
of the former disease.&nbsp; This suggested explanation may not perhaps
apply to the other cases; but we must remember that animals which have
been subjected to such severe operations upon the nervous system have
sustained a great shock, and if they are capable of breeding, it is
only probable that they will produce weak descendants, and such as are
easily affected by disease.&nbsp; Such a result does not, however, explain
why the offspring should suffer from the same disease as that which
was artificially induced in the parents.&nbsp; But this does not appear
to have been by any means invariably the case.&nbsp; Brown-S&eacute;quard
himself says: &lsquo;The changes in the eye of the offspring were of
a very variable nature, and were only occasionally exactly similar to
those observed in the parents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt, however, that these experiments demand
careful consideration, but before they can claim scientific recognition,
they must be subjected to rigid criticism as to the precautions taken,
the nature and number of the control experiments, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to the present time such necessary conditions have not
been sufficiently observed.&nbsp; The recent experiments themselves
are only described in short preliminary notices, which, as regards their
accuracy, the possibility of mistake, the precautions taken, and the
exact succession of individuals affected, afford no data on which a
scientific opinion can be founded&rdquo; (pp. 81, 82).</p>
<p>The line Professor Weismann takes, therefore, is to discredit the
facts; yet on a later page we find that the experiments have since been
repeated by Obersteiner, &ldquo;who has described them in a very exact
and unprejudiced manner,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the fact&rdquo;&mdash;(I
imagine that Professor Weismann intends &ldquo;the facts&rdquo;)&mdash;&ldquo;cannot
be doubted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a still later page, however, we read:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, for instance, it could be shown that artificial mutilation
spontaneously reappears in the offspring with sufficient frequency to
exclude all possibilities of chance, then such proof [i.e. that acquired
characters can be transmitted] would be forthcoming.&nbsp; The transmission
of mutilations has been frequently asserted, and has been even recently
again brought forward, but all the supposed instances have broken down
when carefully examined&rdquo; (p. 390).</p>
<p>Here, then, we are told that proof of the occasional transmission
of mutilations would be sufficient to establish the fact, but on p.
267 we find that no single fact is known which really proves that acquired
characters can be transmitted, &ldquo;<i>for the ascertained facts which
seem to point to the transmission of artificially produced diseases
cannot be considered as proof</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; [Italics mine.]&nbsp;
Perhaps; but it was mutilation in many cases that Professor Weismann
practically admitted to have been transmitted when he declared that
Obersteiner had verified Brown-S&eacute;quard&rsquo;s experiments.</p>
<p>That Professor Weismann recognizes the vital importance to his own
theory of the question whether or no mutilations can be transmitted
under any circumstances, is evident from a passage on p. 425 of his
work, on which he says: &ldquo;It can hardly be doubted that mutilations
are acquired characters; they do not arise from any tendency contained
in the germ, but are merely the reaction of the body under certain external
influences.&nbsp; They are, as I have recently expressed it, purely
somatogenic characters&mdash;viz. characters which emanate from the
body (<i>soma</i>) only, as opposed to the germ-cells; they are, therefore,
characters that do not arise from the germ itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If mutilations must necessarily be transmitted&rdquo; [which
no one that I know of has maintained], &ldquo;or even if they might
occasionally be transmitted&rdquo; [which cannot, I imagine, be reasonably
questioned], &ldquo;a powerful support would be given to the Lamarckian
principle, and the transmission of functional hypertrophy or atrophy
would thus become highly probable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have not found any further attempt in Professor Weismann&rsquo;s
book to deal with the evidence adduced by Mr. Darwin to show that mutilations,
if followed by diseases, are sometimes inherited; and I must leave it
to the reader to determine how far Professor Weismann has shown reason
for rejecting Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s conclusion.&nbsp; I do not, however,
dwell upon these facts now as evidence of a transmitted change of bodily
form, or of instinct due to use and disuse or habit; what they prove
is that the germ-cells within the parent&rsquo;s body do not stand apart
from the other cells of the body so completely as Professor Weismann
would have us believe, but that, as Professor Hering, of Prague, has
aptly said, they echo with more or less frequency and force to the profounder
impressions made upon other cells.</p>
<p>I may say that Professor Weismann does not more cavalierly wave aside
the mass of evidence collected by Mr. Darwin and a host of other writers,
to the effect that mutilations are sometimes inherited, than does Mr.
Wallace, who says that, &ldquo;as regards mutilations, it is generally
admitted that they are not inherited, and there is ample evidence on
this point.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is indeed generally admitted that mutilations,
when not followed by disease, are very rarely, if ever, inherited; and
Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s appeal to the &ldquo;ample evidence&rdquo; which
he alleges to exist on this head, is much as though he should say that
there is ample evidence to show that the days are longer in summer than
in winter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;a
few cases of apparent inheritance of mutilations have been recorded,
and these, if trustworthy, are difficulties in the way of the theory.&rdquo;
. . . &ldquo;The often-quoted case of a disease induced by mutilation
being inherited (Brown-S&eacute;quard&rsquo;s epileptic guinea-pigs)
has been discussed by Professor Weismann and shown to be not conclusive.&nbsp;
The mutilation itself&mdash;a section of certain nerves&mdash;was never
inherited, but the resulting epilepsy, or a general state of weakness,
deformity, or sores, was sometimes inherited.&nbsp; It is, however,
possible that the mere injury introduced and encouraged the growth of
certain microbes, which, spreading through the organism, sometimes reached
the germ-cells, and thus transmitted a diseased condition to the offspring.&rdquo;
<a name="citation286"></a><a href="#footnote286">{286}</a></p>
<p>I suppose a microbe which made guinea-pigs eat their toes off was
communicated to the germ-cells of an unfortunate guinea-pig which had
been already microbed by it, and made the offspring bite its toes off
too.&nbsp; The microbe has a good deal to answer for.</p>
<p>On the case of the deterioration of horses in the Falkland Islands
after a few generations, Professor Weismann says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such a case we have only to assume that the climate which
is unfavourable, and nutriment which is insufficient for horses, affect
not only the animal as a whole but also its germ-cells.&nbsp; This would
result in the diminution in size of the germ-cells, the effects upon
the offspring being still further intensified by the insufficient nourishment
supplied during growth.&nbsp; But such results would not depend upon
the transmission by the germ-cells of certain peculiarities due to the
unfavourable climate, which only appear in the full-grown horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Professor Weismann does not like such cases, and admits that
he cannot explain the facts in connection with the climatic varieties
of certain butterflies, except &ldquo;by supposing the passive acquisition
of characters produced by the direct influence of climate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in his next paragraph but one he calls such cases &ldquo;doubtful,&rdquo;
and proposes that for the moment they should be left aside.&nbsp; He
accordingly leaves them, but I have not yet found what other moment
he considered auspicious for returning to them.&nbsp; He tells us that
&ldquo;new experiments will be necessary, and that he has himself already
begun to undertake them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps he will give us the results
of these experiments in some future book&mdash;for that they will prove
satisfactory to him can hardly, I think, be doubted.&nbsp; He writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaving on one side, for the moment, these doubtful and insufficiently
investigated cases, we may still maintain that the assumption that changes
induced by external conditions in the organism as a whole are communicated
to the germ-cells after the manner indicated in Darwin&rsquo;s hypothesis
of pangenesis, is wholly unnecessary for the explanation of these phenomena.&nbsp;
Still we cannot exclude the possibility of such a transmission occasionally
occurring, for even if the greater part of the effects must be attributable
to natural selection, there might be a smaller part in certain cases
which depends on this exceptional factor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I repeatedly tried to understand Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory of pangenesis,
and so often failed that I long since gave the matter up in despair.&nbsp;
I did so with the less unwillingness because I saw that no one else
appeared to understand the theory, and that even Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
warmest adherents regarded it with disfavour.&nbsp; If Mr. Darwin means
that every cell of the body throws off minute particles that find their
way to the germ-cells, and hence into the new embryo, this is indeed
difficult of comprehension and belief.&nbsp; If he means that the rhythms
or vibrations that go on ceaselessly in every cell of the body communicate
themselves with greater or less accuracy or perturbation, as the case
may be, to the cells that go to form offspring, and that since the characteristics
of matter are determined by vibrations, in communicating vibrations
they in effect communicate matter, according to the view put forward
in the last chapter of my book <i>Luck or Cunning</i>, then we can better
understand it.&nbsp; I have nothing, however, to do with Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
theory of pangenesis beyond avoiding the pretence that I understand
either the theory itself or what Professor Weismann says about it; all
I am concerned with is Professor Weismann&rsquo;s admission, made immediately
afterwards, that the somatic cells may, and perhaps sometimes do, impart
characteristics to the germ-cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A complete and satisfactory refutation of such an opinion,&rdquo;
he continues, &ldquo;cannot be brought forward at present&rdquo;; so
I suppose we must wait a little longer, but in the meantime we may again
remark that, if we admit even occasional communication of changes in
the somatic cells to the germ-cells, we have let in the thin end of
the wedge, as Mr. Darwin did when he said that use and disuse did a
good deal towards modification.&nbsp; Buffon, in his first volume on
the lower animals, <a name="citation288"></a><a href="#footnote288">{288}</a>
dwells on the impossibility of stopping the breach once made by admission
of variation at all.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the point,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;were
once gained, that among animals and vegetables there had been, I do
not say several species, but even a single one, which had been produced
in the course of direct descent from another species; if, for example,
it could be once shown that the ass was but a degeneration from the
horse&mdash;then there is no farther limit to be set to the power of
Nature, and we should not be wrong in supposing that with sufficient
time she could have evolved all other organized forms from one primordial
type.&rdquo;&nbsp; So with use and disuse and transmission of acquired
characteristics generally&mdash;once show that a single structure or
instinct is due to habit in preceding generations, and we can impose
no limit on the results achievable by accumulation in this respect,
nor shall we be wrong in conceiving it as possible that all specialization,
whether of structure or instinct, may be due ultimately to habit.</p>
<p>How far this can be shown to be probable is, of course, another matter,
but I am not immediately concerned with this; all I am concerned with
now is to show that the germ-cells not unfrequently become permanently
affected by events that have made a profound impression upon the somatic
cells, in so far that they transmit an obvious reminiscence of the impression
to the embryos which they go subsequently towards forming.&nbsp; This
is all that is necessary for my case, and I do not find that Professor
Weismann, after all, disputes it.</p>
<p>But here, again, comes the difficulty of saying what Professor Weismann
does, and what he does not, dispute.&nbsp; One moment he gives all that
is wanted for the Lamarckian contention, the next he denies common sense
the bare necessaries of life.&nbsp; For a more exhaustive and detailed
criticism of Professor Weismann&rsquo;s position, I would refer the
reader to an admirably clear article by Mr. Sidney H. Vines, which appeared
in <i>Nature</i>, October 24, 1889.&nbsp; I can only say that while
reading Professor Weismann&rsquo;s book, I feel as I do when I read
those of Mr. Darwin, and of a good many other writers on biology whom
I need not name.&nbsp; I become like a fly in a window-pane.&nbsp; I
see the sunshine and freedom beyond, and buzz up and down their pages,
ever hopeful to get through them to the fresh air without, but ever
kept back by a mysterious something, which I feel but cannot either
grasp or see.&nbsp; It was not thus when I read Buffon, Erasmus Darwin,
and Lamarck; it is not thus when I read such articles as Mr. Vines&rsquo;s
just referred to.&nbsp; Love of self-display, and the want of singleness
of mind that it inevitably engenders&mdash;these, I suppose, are the
sins that glaze the casements of most men&rsquo;s minds; and from these,
no matter how hard he tries to free himself, nor how much he despises
them, who is altogether exempt?</p>
<p>Finally, then, when we consider the immense mass of evidence referred
to briefly, but sufficiently, by Mr. Charles Darwin, and referred to
without other, for the most part, than off-hand dismissal by Professor
Weismann in the last of the essays that have been recently translated,
I do not see how anyone who brings an unbiased mind to the question
can hesitate as to the side on which the weight of testimony inclines.&nbsp;
Professor Weismann declares that &ldquo;the transmission of mutilations
may be dismissed into the domain of fable.&rdquo; <a name="citation290"></a><a href="#footnote290">{290}</a>&nbsp;
If so, then, whom can we trust?&nbsp; What is the use of science at
all if the conclusions of a man as competent as I readily admit Mr.
Darwin to have been, on the evidence laid before him from countless
sources, is to be set aside lightly and without giving the clearest
and most cogent explanation of the why and wherefore?&nbsp; When we
see a person &ldquo;ostrichizing&rdquo; the evidence which he has to
meet, as clearly as I believe Professor Weismann to be doing, we shall
in nine cases out of ten be right in supposing that he knows the evidence
to be too strong for him.</p>
<h2>The Deadlock in Darwinism: Part III</h2>
<p>Now let me return to the recent division of biological opinion into
two main streams&mdash;Lamarckism and Weismannism.&nbsp; Both Lamarckians
and Weismannists, not to mention mankind in general, admit that the
better adapted to its surroundings a living form may be, the more likely
it is to outbreed its compeers.&nbsp; The world at large, again, needs
not to be told that the normal course is not unfrequently deflected
through the fortunes of war; nevertheless, according to Lamarckians
and Erasmus-Darwinians, habitual effort, guided by ever-growing intelligence&mdash;that
is to say, by continued increase of power in the matter of knowing our
likes and dislikes&mdash;has been so much the main factor throughout
the course of organic development, that the rest, though not lost sight
of, may be allowed to go without saying.&nbsp; According, on the other
hand, to extreme Charles-Darwinians and Weismannists, habit, effort
and intelligence acquired during the experience of any one life goes
for nothing.&nbsp; Not even a little fraction of it endures to the benefit
of offspring.&nbsp; It dies with him in whom it is acquired, and the
heirs of a man&rsquo;s body take no interest therein.&nbsp; To state
this doctrine is to arouse instinctive loathing; it is my fortunate
task to maintain that such a nightmare of waste and death is as baseless
as it is repulsive.</p>
<p>The split in biological opinion occasioned by the deadlock to which
Charles-Darwinism has been reduced, though comparatively recent, widens
rapidly.&nbsp; Ten years ago Lamarck&rsquo;s name was mentioned only
as a byword for extravagance; now, we cannot take up a number of <i>Nature</i>
without seeing how hot the contention is between his followers and those
of Weismann.&nbsp; This must be referred, as I implied earlier, to growing
perception that Mr. Darwin should either have gone farther towards Lamarckism
or not so far.&nbsp; In admitting use and disuse as freely as he did,
he gave Lamarckians leverage for the overthrow of a system based ostensibly
on the accumulation of fortunate accidents.&nbsp; In assigning the lion&rsquo;s
share of development to the accumulation of fortunate accidents, he
tempted fortuitists to try to cut the ground from under Lamarck&rsquo;s
feet by denying that the effects of use and disuse can be inherited
at all.&nbsp; When the public had once got to understand what Lamarck
had intended, and wherein Mr. Charles Darwin had differed from him,
it became impossible for Charles-Darwinians to remain where they were,
nor is it easy to see what course was open to them except to cast about
for a theory by which they could get rid of use and disuse altogether.&nbsp;
Weismannism, therefore, is the inevitable outcome of the straits to
which Charles-Darwinians were reduced through the way in which their
leader had halted between two opinions.</p>
<p>This is why Charles-Darwinians, from Professor Huxley downwards,
have kept the difference between Lamarck&rsquo;s opinions and those
of Mr. Darwin so much in the background.&nbsp; Unwillingness to make
this understood is nowhere manifested more clearly than in Dr. Francis
Darwin&rsquo;s life of his father.&nbsp; In this work Lamarck is sneered
at once or twice and told to go away, but there is no attempt to state
the two cases side by side; from which, as from not a little else, I
conclude that Dr. Francis Darwin has descended from his father with
singularly little modification.</p>
<p>Proceeding to the evidence for the transmissions of acquired habits,
I will quote two recently adduced examples from among the many that
have been credibly attested.&nbsp; The first was contributed to <i>Nature</i>
(March 14, 1889) by Professor Marcus M. Hartog, who wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A. B. is moderately myopic and very astigmatic in the left
eye; extremely myopic in the right.&nbsp; As the left eye gave such
bad images for near objects, he was compelled in childhood to mask it,
and acquired the habit of leaning his head on his left arm for writing,
so as to blind that eye, or of resting the left temple and eye on the
hand, with the elbow on the table.&nbsp; At the age of fifteen the eyes
were equalized by the use of suitable spectacles, and he soon lost the
habit completely and permanently.&nbsp; He is now the father of two
children, a boy and a girl, whose vision (tested repeatedly and fully)
is emmetropic in both eyes, so that they have not inherited the congenital
optical defect of their father.&nbsp; All the same, they have both of
them inherited his early acquired habit, and need constant watchfulness
to prevent their hiding the left eye when writing, by resting the head
on the left forearm or hand.&nbsp; Imitation is here quite out of the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering that every habit involves changes in the proportional
development of the muscular and osseous systems, and hence probably
of the nervous system also, the importance of inherited habits, natural
or acquired, cannot be overlooked in the general theory of inheritance.&nbsp;
I am fully aware that I shall be accused of flat Lamarckism, but a nickname
is not an argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Professor Ray Lankester rejoined (<i>Nature</i>, March 21,
1889):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not unusual for children to rest the head on the left
forearm or hand when writing, and I doubt whether much value can be
attached to the case described by Professor Hartog.&nbsp; The kind of
observation which his letter suggests is, however, likely to lead to
results either for or against the transmission of acquired characters.&nbsp;
An old friend of mine lost his right arm when a schoolboy, and has ever
since written with his left.&nbsp; He has a large family and grandchildren,
but I have not heard of any of them showing a disposition to left-handedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From <i>Nature</i> (March 21, 1889) I take the second instance communicated
by Mr. J. Jenner-Weir, who wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Marcus M. Hartog&rsquo;s letter of March 6th, inserted
in last week&rsquo;s number (p. 462), is a very valuable contribution
to the growing evidence that acquired characters may be inherited.&nbsp;
I have long held the view that such is often the case, and I have myself
observed several instances of the, at least I may say, apparent fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many years ago there was a very fine male of the <i>Capra
megaceros</i> in the gardens of the Zoological Society.&nbsp; To restrain
this animal from jumping over the fence of the enclosure in which he
was confined, a long and heavy chain was attached to the collar round
his neck.&nbsp; He was constantly in the habit of taking this chain
up by his horns and moving it from one side to another over his back;
in doing this he threw his head very much back, his horns being placed
in a line with the back.&nbsp; The habit had become quite chronic with
him, and was very tiresome to look at.&nbsp; I was very much astonished
to observe that his offspring inherited the habit, and although it was
not necessary to attach a chain to their necks, I have often seen a
young male throwing his horns over his back and shifting from side to
side an imaginary chain.&nbsp; The action was exactly the same as that
of his ancestor.&nbsp; The case of the kid of this goat appears to me
to be parallel to that of child and parent given by Mr. Hartog.&nbsp;
I think at the time I made this observation I informed Mr. Darwin of
the fact by letter, and he did not accuse me of &lsquo;flat Lamarckism.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this letter there was no rejoinder.&nbsp; It may be said, of course,
that the action of the offspring in each of these cases was due to accidental
coincidence only.&nbsp; Anything can be said, but the question turns
not on what an advocate can say, but on what a reasonably intelligent
and disinterested jury will believe; granted they might be mistaken
in accepting the foregoing stories, but the world of science, like that
of commerce, is based on the faith or confidence which both creates
and sustains them.&nbsp; Indeed the universe itself is but the creature
of faith, for assuredly we know of no other foundation.&nbsp; There
is nothing so generally and reasonably accepted&mdash;not even our own
continued identity&mdash;but questions may be raised about it that will
shortly prove unanswerable.&nbsp; We cannot so test every sixpence given
us in change as to be sure that we never take a bad one, and had better
sometimes be cheated than reduce caution to an absurdity.&nbsp; Moreover,
we have seen from the evidence given in my preceding article that the
germ-cells issuing from a parent&rsquo;s body can, and do, respond to
profound impressions made on the somatic cells.&nbsp; This being so,
what impressions are more profound, what needs engage more assiduous
attention than those connected with self-protection, the procuring of
food, and the continuation of the species?&nbsp; If the mere anxiety
connected with an ill-healing wound inflicted on but one generation
is sometimes found to have so impressed the germ-cells that they hand
down its scars to offspring, how much more shall not anxieties that
have directed action of all kinds from birth till death, not in one
generation only but in a longer series of generations than the mind
can realize to itself, modify, and indeed control, the organization
of every species?</p>
<p>I see Professor S. H. Vines, in the article on Weismann&rsquo;s theory
referred to in my preceding article, says Mr. Darwin &ldquo;held that
it was not the sudden variations due to altered external conditions
which become permanent, but those slowly produced by what he termed
&lsquo;the accumulative action of changed conditions of life.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nothing can be more soundly Lamarckian, and nothing should more conclusively
show that, whatever else Mr. Darwin was, he was not a Charles-Darwinian;
but what evidence other than inferential can from the nature of the
case be adduced in support of this, as I believe, perfectly correct
judgment?&nbsp; None know better than they who clamour for direct evidence
that their master was right in taking the position assigned to him by
Professor Vines, that they cannot reasonably look for it.&nbsp; With
us, as with themselves, modification proceeds very gradually, and it
violates our principles as much as their own to expect visible permanent
progress, in any single generation, or indeed in any number of generations
of wild species which we have yet had time to observe.&nbsp; Occasionally
we can find such cases, as in that of <i>Branchipus stagnalis</i>, quoted
by Mr. Wallace, or in that of the New Zealand Kea whose skin, I was
assured by the late Sir Julius von Haast, has already been modified
as a consequence of its change of food.&nbsp; Here we can show that
in even a few generations structure is modified under changed conditions
of existence, but as we believe these cases to occur comparatively rarely,
so it is still more rarely that they occur when and where we can watch
them.&nbsp; Nature is eminently conservative, and fixity of type, even
under considerable change of conditions, is surely more important for
the well-being of any species than an over-ready power of adaptation
to, it may be, passing changes.&nbsp; There could be no steady progress
if each generation were not mainly bound by the traditions of those
that have gone before it.&nbsp; It is evolution and not incessant revolution
that both parties are upholding; and this being so, rapid visible modification
must be the exception, not the rule.&nbsp; I have quoted direct evidence
adduced by competent observers, which is, I believe, sufficient to establish
the fact that offspring can be and is sometimes modified by the acquired
habits of a progenitor.&nbsp; I will now proceed to the still more,
as it appears to me, cogent proof afforded by general considerations.</p>
<p>What, let me ask, are the principal phenomena of heredity?&nbsp;
There must be physical continuity between parent, or parents, and offspring,
so that the offspring is, as Erasmus Darwin well said, a kind of elongation
of the life of the parent.</p>
<p>Erasmus Darwin put the matter so well that I may as well give his
words in full; he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owing to the imperfection of language the offspring is termed
a new animal, but is in truth a branch or elongation of the parent,
since a part of the embryon animal is, or was, a part of the parent,
and therefore, in strict language, cannot be said to be entirely new
at the time of its production; and therefore it may retain some of the
habits of the parent system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the earliest period of its existence the embryon would
seem to consist of a living filament with certain capabilities of irritation,
sensation, volition, and association, and also with some acquired habits
or propensities peculiar to the parent; the former of these are in common
with other animals; the latter seem to distinguish or produce the kind
of animal, whether man or quadruped, with the similarity of feature
or form to the parent.&rdquo; <a name="citation299"></a><a href="#footnote299">{299}</a></p>
<p>Those who accept evolution insist on unbroken physical continuity
between the earliest known life and ourselves, so that we both are and
are not personally identical with the unicellular organism from which
we have descended in the course of many millions of years, exactly in
the same ways as an octogenarian both is and is not personally identical
with the microscopic impregnate ovum from which he grew up.&nbsp; Everything
both is and is not.&nbsp; There is no such thing as strict identity
between any two things in any two consecutive seconds.&nbsp; In strictness
they are identical and yet not identical, so that in strictness they
violate a fundamental rule of strictness&mdash;namely, that a thing
shall never be itself and not itself at one and the same time; we must
choose between logic and dealing in a practical spirit with time and
space; it is not surprising, therefore, that logic, in spite of the
show of respect outwardly paid to her, is told to stand aside when people
come to practice.&nbsp; In practice identity is generally held to exist
where continuity is only broken slowly and piecemeal; nevertheless,
that occasional periods of even rapid change are not held to bar identity,
appears from the fact that no one denies this to hold between the microscopically
small impregnate ovum and the born child that springs from it, nor yet,
therefore, between the impregnate ovum and the octogenarian into which
the child grows; for both ovum and octogenarian are held personally
identical with the new-born baby, and things that are identical with
the same are identical with one another.</p>
<p>The first, then, and most important element of heredity is that there
should be unbroken continuity, and hence sameness of personality, between
parents and offspring, in neither more nor less than the same sense
as that in which any other two personalities are said to be the same.&nbsp;
The repetition, therefore, of its developmental stages by any offspring
must be regarded as something which the embryo repeating them has already
done once, in the person of one or other parent; and if once, then,
as many times as there have been generations between any given embryo
now repeating it, and the point in life from which we started&mdash;say,
for example, the amoeba.&nbsp; In the case of asexually and sexually
produced organisms alike, the offspring must be held to continue the
personality of the parent or parents, and hence on the occasion of every
fresh development, to be repeating something which in the person of
its parent or parents it has done once, and if once, then any number
of times, already.</p>
<p>It is obvious, therefore, that the germ-plasm (or whatever the fancy
word for it may be) of any one generation is as physically identical
with the germ-plasm of its predecessor as any two things can be.&nbsp;
The difference between Professor Weismann and, we will say, Heringians
consists in the fact that the first maintains the new germ-plasm when
on the point of repeating its developmental processes to take practically
no cognisance of anything that has happened to it since the last occasion
on which it developed itself; while the latter maintain that offspring
takes much the same kind of account of what has happened to it in the
persons of its parents since the last occasion on which it developed
itself, as people in ordinary life take things that happen to them.&nbsp;
In daily life people let fairly normal circumstances come and go without
much heed as matters of course.&nbsp; If they have been lucky they make
a note of it and try to repeat their success.&nbsp; If they have been
unfortunate but have recovered rapidly they soon forget it; if they
have suffered long and deeply they grizzle over it and are scared and
scarred by it for a long time.&nbsp; The question is one of cognisance
or non-cognisance on the part of the new germs, of the more profound
impressions made on them while they were one with their parents, between
the occasion of their last preceding development and the new course
on which they are about to enter.&nbsp; Those who accept the theory
put forward independently by Professor Hering of Prague (whose work
on this subject is translated in my book <i>Unconscious Memory</i>)
and by myself in <i>Life and Habit</i>, believe in cognisance as do
Lamarckians generally.&nbsp; Weismannites, and with them the orthodoxy
of English science, find non-cognisance more acceptable.</p>
<p>If the Heringian view is accepted, that heredity is only a mode of
memory, and an extension of memory from one generation to another, then
the repetition of its development by any embryo thus becomes only the
repetition of a lesson learned by rote; and, as I have elsewhere said,
our view of life is simplified by finding that it is no longer an equation
of, say, a hundred unknown quantities, but of ninety-nine only, inasmuch
as two of the unknown quantities prove to be substantially identical.&nbsp;
In this case the inheritance of acquired characteristics cannot be disputed,
for it is postulated in the theory that each embryo takes note of, remembers
and is guided by the profounder impressions made upon it while in the
persons of its parents, between its present and last preceding development.&nbsp;
To maintain this is to maintain use and disuse to be the main factors
throughout organic development; to deny it is to deny that use and disuse
can have any conceivable effect.&nbsp; For the detailed reasons which
led me to my own conclusions I must refer the reader to my books <i>Life
and Habit</i> and <i>Unconscious Memory</i>, the conclusions of which
have been often adopted, but never, that I have seen, disputed.&nbsp;
A brief r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the leading points in the argument is
all that space will here allow me to give.</p>
<p>We have seen that it is a first requirement of heredity that there
shall be physical continuity between parents and offspring.&nbsp; This
holds good with memory.&nbsp; There must be continued identity between
the person remembering and the person to whom the thing that is remembered
happened.&nbsp; We cannot remember things that happened to someone else,
and in our absence.&nbsp; We can only remember having heard of them.&nbsp;
We have seen, however, that there is as much <i>bona-fide</i> sameness
of personality between parents and offspring up to the time at which
the offspring quits the parent&rsquo;s body, as there is between the
different states of the parent himself at any two consecutive moments;
the offspring therefore, being one and the same person with its progenitors
until it quits them, can be held to remember what happened to them within,
of course, the limitations to which all memory is subject, as much as
the progenitors can remember what happened earlier to themselves.&nbsp;
Whether it does so remember can only be settled by observing whether
it acts as living beings commonly do when they are acting under guidance
of memory.&nbsp; I will endeavour to show that, though heredity and
habit based on memory go about in different dresses, yet if we catch
them separately&mdash;for they are never seen together&mdash;and strip
them there is not a mole nor strawberry-mark nor trick nor leer of the
one, but we find it in the other also.</p>
<p>What are the moles and strawberry-marks of habitual action, or actions
remembered and thus repeated?&nbsp; First, the more often we repeat
them the more easily and unconsciously we do them.&nbsp; Look at reading,
writing, walking, talking, playing the piano, etc.; the longer we have
practised any one of these acquired habits, the more easily, automatically
and unconsciously, we perform it.&nbsp; Look, on the other hand, broadly,
at the three points to which I called attention in <i>Life and Habit</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; That we are most conscious of and have most control over
such habits as speech, the upright position, the arts and sciences&mdash;which
are acquisitions peculiar to the human race, always acquired after birth,
and not common to ourselves and any ancestor who had not become entirely
human.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; That we are less conscious of and have less control over
eating and drinking [provided the food be normal], swallowing, breathing,
seeing, and hearing&mdash;which were acquisitions of our prehuman ancestry,
and for which we had provided ourselves with all the necessary apparatus
before we saw light, but which are still, geologically speaking, recent.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; That we are most unconscious of and have least control
over our digestion and circulation&mdash;powers possessed even by our
invertebrate ancestry, and, geologically speaking, of extreme antiquity.</p>
<p>I have put the foregoing very broadly, but enough is given to show
the reader the gist of the argument.&nbsp; Let it be noted that disturbance
and departure, to any serious extent, from normal practice tends to
induce resumption of consciousness even in the case of such old habits
as breathing, seeing, and hearing, digestion and the circulation of
the blood.&nbsp; So it is with habitual actions in general.&nbsp; Let
a player be never so proficient on any instrument, he will be put out
if the normal conditions under which he plays are too widely departed
from, and will then do consciously, if indeed he can do it at all, what
he had hitherto been doing unconsciously.&nbsp; It is an axiom as regards
actions acquired after birth, that we never do them automatically save
as the result of long practice; the stages in the case of any acquired
facility, the inception of which we have been able to watch, have invariably
been from a nothingness of ignorant impotence to a little somethingness
of highly self-conscious, arduous performance, and thence to the unselfconsciousness
of easy mastery.&nbsp; I saw one year a poor blind lad of about eighteen
sitting on a wall by the wayside at Varese, playing the concertina with
his whole body, and snorting like a child.&nbsp; The next year the boy
no longer snorted, and he played with his fingers only; the year after
that he seemed hardly to know whether he was playing or not, it came
so easily to him.&nbsp; I know no exception to this rule.&nbsp; Where
is the intricate and at one time difficult art in which perfect automatic
ease has been reached except as the result of long practice?&nbsp; If,
then, wherever we can trace the development of automatism we find it
to have taken this course, is it not most reasonable to infer that it
has taken the same even when it has risen in regions that are beyond
our ken?&nbsp; Ought we not, whenever we see a difficult action performed
automatically, to suspect antecedent practice?&nbsp; Granted that without
the considerations in regard to identity presented above it would not
have been easy to see where a baby of a day old could have had the practice
which enables it to do as much as it does unconsciously, but even without
these considerations it would have been more easy to suppose that the
necessary opportunities had not been wanting, than that the easy performance
could have been gained without practice and memory.</p>
<p>When I wrote <i>Life and Habit</i> (originally published in 1877)
I said in slightly different words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we say that a baby of a day old sucks (which involves
the whole principle of the pump and hence a profound practical knowledge
of the laws of pneumatics and hydrostatics), digests, oxygenizes its
blood&mdash;millions of years before anyone had discovered oxygen&mdash;sees
and hears, operations that involve an unconscious knowledge of the facts
concerning optics and acoustics compared with which the conscious discoveries
of Newton are insignificant&mdash;shall we say that a baby can do all
these things at once, doing them so well and so regularly without being
even able to give them attention, and yet without mistake, and shall
we also say at the same time that it has not learnt to do them, and
never did them before?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such an assertion would contradict the whole experience of
mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have met with nothing during the thirteen years since the foregoing
was published that has given me any qualms about its soundness.&nbsp;
From the point of view of the law courts and everyday life it is, of
course, nonsense; but in the kingdom of thought, as in that of heaven,
there are many mansions, and what would be extravagance in the cottage
or farm-house, as it were, of daily practice, is but common decency
in the palace of high philosophy, wherein dwells evolution.&nbsp; If
we leave evolution alone, we may stick to common practice and the law
courts; touch evolution and we are in another world; not higher, nor
lower, but different as harmony from counterpoint.&nbsp; As, however,
in the most absolute counterpoint there is still harmony, and in the
most absolute harmony still counterpoint, so high philosophy should
be still in touch with common sense, and common sense with high philosophy.</p>
<p>The common-sense view of the matter to people who are not over-curious
and to whom time is money, will be that a baby is not a baby until it
is born, and that when born it should be born in wedlock.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
as a sop to high philosophy, every baby is allowed to be the offspring
of its father and mother.</p>
<p>The high-philosophy view of the matter is that every human being
is still but a fresh edition of the primordial cell with the latest
additions and corrections; there has been no leap nor break in continuity
anywhere; the man of to-day is the primordial cell of millions of years
ago as truly as he is the himself of yesterday; he can only be denied
to be the one on grounds that will prove him not to be the other.&nbsp;
Everyone is both himself and all his direct ancestors and descendants
as well; therefore, if we would be logical, he is one also with all
his cousins, no matter how distant, for he and they are alike identical
with the primordial cell, and we have already noted it as an axiom that
things which are identical with the same are identical with one another.&nbsp;
This is practically making him one with all living things, whether animal
or vegetable, that ever have existed or ever will&mdash;something of
all which may have been in the mind of Sophocles when he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nor seest thou yet the gathering hosts of ill<br />
That shall en-one thee both with thine own self<br />
And with thine offspring.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And all this has come of admitting that a man may be the same person
for two days running!&nbsp; As for sopping common sense it will be enough
to say that these remarks are to be taken in a strictly scientific sense,
and have no appreciable importance as regards life and conduct.&nbsp;
True they deal with the foundations on which all life and conduct are
based, but like other foundations they are hidden out of sight, and
the sounder they are, the less we trouble ourselves about them.</p>
<p>What other main common features between heredity and memory may we
note besides the fact that neither can exist without that kind of physical
continuity which we call personal identity?&nbsp; First, the development
of the embryo proceeds in an established order; so must all habitual
actions based on memory.&nbsp; Disturb the normal order and the performance
is arrested.&nbsp; The better we know &ldquo;God save the Queen,&rdquo;
the less easily can we play or sing it backwards.&nbsp; The return of
memory again depends on the return of ideas associated with the particular
thing that is remembered&mdash;we remember nothing but for the presence
of these, and when enough of these are presented to us we remember everything.&nbsp;
So, if the development of an embryo is due to memory, we should suppose
the memory of the impregnate ovum to revert not to yesterday, when it
was in the persons of its parents, but to the last occasion on which
it was an impregnate ovum.&nbsp; The return of the old environment and
the presence of old associations would at once involve recollection
of the course that should be next taken, and the same should happen
throughout the whole course of development.&nbsp; The actual course
of development presents precisely the phenomena agreeable with this.&nbsp;
For fuller treatment of this point I must refer the reader to the chapter
on the abeyance of memory in my book <i>Life and Habit</i>, already
referred to.</p>
<p>Secondly, we remember best our last few performances of any given
kind, so our present performance will probably resemble some one or
other of these; we remember our earlier performances by way of residuum
only, but every now and then we revert to an earlier habit.&nbsp; This
feature of memory is manifested in heredity by the way in which offspring
commonly resembles most its nearer ancestors, but sometimes reverts
to earlier ones.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, each as it were giving
their own version of the same story, but in different words, should
generally resemble each other more closely than more distant relations.&nbsp;
And this is what actually we find.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the introduction of slightly new elements into a method
already established varies it beneficially; the new is soon fused with
the old, and the monotony ceases to be oppressive.&nbsp; But if the
new be too foreign, we cannot fuse the old and the new&mdash;nature
seeming to hate equally too wide a deviation from ordinary practice
and none at all.&nbsp; This fact reappears in heredity as the beneficial
effects of occasional crossing on the one hand, and on the other, in
the generally observed sterility of hybrids.&nbsp; If heredity be an
affair of memory, how can an embryo, say of a mule, be expected to build
up a mule on the strength of but two mule-memories?&nbsp; Hybridism
causes a fault in the chain of memory, and it is to this cause that
the usual sterility of hybrids must be referred.</p>
<p>Fourthly, it requires many repeated impressions to fix a method firmly,
but when it has been engrained into us we cease to have much recollection
of the manner in which it came to be so, or indeed of any individual
repetition, but sometimes a single impression if prolonged as well as
profound, produces a lasting impression and is liable to return with
sudden force, and then to go on returning to us at intervals.&nbsp;
As a general rule, however, abnormal impressions cannot long hold their
own against the overwhelming preponderance of normal authority.&nbsp;
This appears in heredity as the normal non-inheritance of mutilations
on the one hand, and on the other as their occasional inheritance in
the case of injuries followed by disease.</p>
<p>Fifthly, if heredity and memory are essentially the same, we should
expect that no animal would develop new structures of importance after
the age at which its species begins ordinarily to continue its race;
for we cannot suppose offspring to remember anything that happens to
the parent subsequently to the parent&rsquo;s ceasing to contain the
offspring within itself.&nbsp; From the average age, therefore, of reproduction,
offspring should cease to have any further steady, continuous memory
to fall back upon; what memory there is should be full of faults, and
as such unreliable.&nbsp; An organism ought to develop as long as it
is backed by memory&mdash;that is to say, until the average age at which
reproduction begins; it should then continue to go for a time on the
impetus already received, and should eventually decay through failure
of any memory to support it, and tell it what to do.&nbsp; This corresponds
absolutely with what we observe in organisms generally, and explains,
on the one hand, why the age of puberty marks the beginning of completed
development&mdash;a riddle hitherto not only unexplained but, so far
as I have seen, unasked; it explains, on the other hand, the phenomena
of old age&mdash;hitherto without even attempt at explanation.</p>
<p>Sixthly, those organisms that are the longest in reaching maturity
should on the average be the longest-lived, for they will have received
the most momentous impulse from the weight of memory behind them.&nbsp;
This harmonizes with the latest opinion as to the facts.&nbsp; In his
article of Weismann in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> for May, 1890,
Mr. Romanes writes: &ldquo;Professor Weismann has shown that there is
throughout the metazoa a general correlation between the natural lifetime
of individuals composing any given species, and the age at which they
reach maturity or first become capable of procreation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This, I believe, has been the conclusion generally arrived at by biologists
for some years past.</p>
<p>Lateness, then, in the average age of reproduction appears to be
the principle underlying longevity.&nbsp; There does not appear at first
sight to be much connection between such distinct and apparently disconnected
phenomena as 1, the orderly normal progress of development; 2, atavism
and the resumption of feral characteristics; 3, the more ordinary resemblance
<i>inter se</i> of nearer relatives; 4, the benefit of an occasional
cross, and the usual sterility of hybrids; 5, the unconsciousness with
which alike bodily development and ordinary physiological functions
proceed, so long as they are normal; 6, the ordinary non-inheritance,
but occasional inheritance of mutilations; 7, the fact that puberty
indicates the approach of maturity; 8, the phenomena of middle life
and old age; 9, the principle underlying longevity.&nbsp; These phenomena
have no conceivable bearing on one another until heredity and memory
are regarded as part of the same story.&nbsp; Identify these two things,
and I know no phenomenon of heredity that does not immediately become
infinitely more intelligible.&nbsp; Is it conceivable that a theory
which harmonizes so many facts hitherto regarded as without either connection
or explanation should not deserve at any rate consideration from those
who profess to take an interest in biology?</p>
<p>It is not as though the theory were unknown, or had been condemned
by our leading men of science.&nbsp; Professor Ray Lankester introduced
it to English readers in an appreciative notice of Professor Hering&rsquo;s
address, which appeared in <i>Nature</i>, July 13, 1876.&nbsp; He wrote
to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, March 24, 1884, and claimed credit for
having done so, but I do not believe he has ever said more in public
about it than what I have here referred to.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes did indeed
try to crush it in <i>Nature</i>, January 27,1881, but in 1883, in his
<i>Mental Evolution in Animals</i>, he adopted its main conclusion without
acknowledgment.&nbsp; The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, to my unbounded surprise,
called him to task for this (March 1, 1884), and since that time he
has given the Heringian theory a sufficiently wide berth.&nbsp; Mr.
Wallace showed himself favourably enough disposed towards the view that
heredity and memory are part of the same story when he reviewed my book
<i>Life and Habit</i> in <i>Nature</i>, March 27, 1879, but he has never
since betrayed any sign of being aware that such a theory existed.&nbsp;
Mr. Herbert Spencer wrote to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> (April 5, 1884),
and claimed the theory for himself, but, in spite of his doing this,
he has never, that I have seen, referred to the matter again.&nbsp;
I have dealt sufficiently with his claim in my book <i>Luck or Cunning</i>.&nbsp;
Lastly, Professor Hering himself has never that I know of touched his
own theory since the single short address read in 1870, and translated
by me in 1881.&nbsp; Everyone, even its originator, except myself, seems
afraid to open his mouth about it.&nbsp; Of course the inference suggests
itself that other people have more sense than I have.&nbsp; I readily
admit it; but why have so many of our leaders shown such a strong hankering
after the theory, if there is nothing in it?</p>
<p>The deadlock that I have pointed out as existing in Darwinism will,
I doubt not, lead ere long to a consideration of Professor Hering&rsquo;s
theory.&nbsp; English biologists are little likely to find Weismann
satisfactory for long, and if he breaks down there is nothing left for
them but Lamarck, supplemented by the important and elucidatory corollary
on his theory proposed by Professor Hering.&nbsp; When the time arrives
for this to obtain a hearing it will be confirmed, doubtless, by arguments
clearer and more forcible than any I have been able to adduce; I shall
then be delighted to resign the championship which till then I shall
continue, as for some years past, to have much pleasure in sustaining.&nbsp;
Heretofore my satisfaction has mainly lain in the fact that more of
our prominent men of science have seemed anxious to claim the theory
than to refute it; in the confidence thus engendered I leave it to any
fuller consideration which the outline I have above given may incline
the reader to bestow upon it.</p>

Since this essay was written it has been ascertained by Cavaliere Francesco
Negri, of Casale Monferrato, that Tabachetti died in 1615.&nbsp; If,
therefore, the Sanctuary of Montrigone was not founded until 1631, it
is plain that Tabachetti cannot have worked there.&nbsp; All the latest
discoveries about Tabachetti&rsquo;s career will be found in Cavaliere
Negri&rsquo;s pamphlet <i>Il Santuario di Crea</i> (Alessandria, 1902).&nbsp;

M. Ruppen&rsquo;s words run: &ldquo;1687 wurde die Kapelle zur hohen
Stiege gebaut, 1747 durch Zusatz vergr&ouml;ssert und 1755 mit Orgeln
ausgestattet.&nbsp; Anton Ruppen, ein geschickter Steinhauer und Maurermeister
leitete den Kapellebau, und machte darin das kleinere Alt&auml;rlein.&nbsp;
Bei der hohen Stiege war fr&uuml;her kein Gebetsh&auml;uslein; nur ein
wunderth&auml;tiges Bildlein der Mutter Gottes stand da in einer Mauer
vor dem fromme Hirten und viel and&auml;chtiges Volk unter freiem Himmel
beteten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1709 wurden die kleinen Kapellelein die 15 Geheimnisse des
Psalters vorstellend auf dem Wege zur hohen Stiege gebaut.&nbsp; Jeder
Haushalter des Viertels F&eacute;e &uuml;bernahm den Bau eines dieser
Geheimnisskapellen, und ein besonderer Gutth&auml;ter dieser frommen
Unternehmung war Heinrich Andenmatten, nachhet Bruder der Gesellschaft
Jesu.&rdquo;</p>

The story of Tabachetti&rsquo;s insanity and imprisonment is very doubtful,
and it is difficult to make his supposed visit to Saas fit in with the
authentic facts of his life.&nbsp; Cavaliere Negri, to whose pamphlet
on Tabachetti I have already referred the reader, mentions neither.&nbsp;
Tabachetti left his native Dinant in 1585, and from that date until
his death he appears to have lived chiefly at Varallo and Crea.&nbsp;
In 1588 he was working at Crea; in 1590 he was at Varallo and again
in 1594, 1599, and 1602.&nbsp; He died in 1615, possibly during a visit
to Varallo, though his home at the time was at Costigliole, near Asti.&mdash;R.

die von den Steinmatten an bis zur Kirche am Ufer der Visp lag, wurde
ganz zerst&ouml;rt.&nbsp; Man ward gezwungen eine neue Strasse in einiger

Mr. J. T. Cunningham, of the Marine Biological Laboratory, Plymouth,
has called my attention to the fact that I have ascribed to Professor
Ray Lankester a criticism on Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s remarks upon the eyes
of certain flat-fish, which Professor Ray Lankester was, in reality,
only adopting&mdash;with full acknowledgment&mdash;from Mr. Cunningham.&nbsp;
Mr. Cunningham has left it to me whether to correct my omission publicly
or not, but he would so plainly prefer my doing so that I consider myself
bound to insert this note.&nbsp; Curiously enough, I find that in my
book <i>Evolution</i>, <i>Old and New</i> I gave what Lamarck actually
said upon the eyes of flat-fish, and, having been led to return to the
subject, I may as well quote his words.&nbsp; He wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need&mdash;always occasioned by the circumstances in which
an animal is placed, and followed by sustained efforts at gratification&mdash;can
not only modify an organ&mdash;that is to say, augment or reduce it&mdash;but
can change its position when the case requires its removal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ocean fishes have occasion to see what is on either side of
them, and have their eyes accordingly placed on either side of their
head.&nbsp; Some fishes, however, have their abode near coasts on submarine
banks and inclinations, and are thus forced to flatten themselves as
much as possible in order to get as near as they can to the shore.&nbsp;
In this situation they receive more light from above than from below,
and find it necessary to pay attention to whatever happens to be above
them; this need has involved the displacement of their eyes, which now
take the remarkable position which we observe in the case of soles,
turbots, plaice, etc.&nbsp; The transfer of position is not even yet
complete in the case of these fishes, and the eyes are not, therefore,
symmetrically placed; but they are so with the skate, whose head and
whole body are equally disposed on either side a longitudinal section.&nbsp;
Hence the eyes of this fish are placed symmetrically upon the uppermost
side.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philosophie Zoologique</i>, tom. i. pp. 250, 251.&nbsp;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
